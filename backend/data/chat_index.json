They found the interactions to be short-lived but fascinating, allowing them to learn about others' backgrounds and values. The user also expressed interest in Ari's concept of a \"6th sense\" that enables connecting with strangers on a deep level, citing an example of Ari sensing a man's physical pain without prior knowledge.\n\nAri shared the practice of \"Treasure Hunting,\" which involves imagining people they will meet in a public place, associating them with positive messages, and then delivering those messages to the individuals when encountered. Ari found this activity to be rewarding, especially when strangers were moved to tears by the kindness shown to them. The user inquired about Ari's frequency of engaging in treasure hunting, with Ari noting that they did it more often during their time in grad school and when attending the farmers market in Santa Cruz.",
            "original_text": "Human 1: Hi!\nAri: What is your favorite holiday?\nHuman 1: one where I get to meet lots of different people.\nAri: What was the most number of people you have ever met during a holiday?\nHuman 1: Hard to keep a count. Maybe 25.\nAri: Which holiday was that?\nHuman 1: I think it was Australia\nAri: Do you still talk to the people you met?\nHuman 1: Not really. The interactions are usually short-lived but it's fascinating to learn where people are coming from and what matters to them\nAri: Yea, me too. I feel like God often puts strangers in front of you, and gives you an opportunity to connect with them in that moment in deeply meaningful ways. Do you ever feel like you know things about strangers without them telling you?\nHuman 1: what do you mean?\nAri: I think it's like a 6th sense, often seen as \"cold readings\" to people, but can be remarkably accurate. I once sat next to a man in a coffee and I felt a pain in my back. I asked the stranger if he had a pain. It turns out that he did in the exact spot, and said he pulled a muscle while dancing at a party. I had never met the man before and never saw him again.\nHuman 1: Wow! That's interesting, borderline spooky\nAri: There's this practice called \"Treasure Hunting\" that's kind of a fun game you play in a public place. There's a book called \"The Ultimate Treasure Hunt\" that talks about it. You use your creativity to imagine people you will meet, and you write down a description, then you associate them with a positive message or encouraging word. Maybe you saw a teenage boy in a red hat at the shopping mall in your imagination, then while at the mall, you may find someone who matches that description. You show that you have a message for him and that you have a message for a boy in a red hat. You then give him a message of kindness or whatever was on your heart. You have no idea, sometimes you meet someone who is having a really hard day, and it brings them to tears to have a stranger show them love.\nHuman 1: So, do you do treasure hunting often?\nAri: I did more when I was in grad school (and had more time). I would usually go with friends. For a while I would go to the farmers market in Santa Cruz every week and try to feel if there is something I am supposed to tell a stranger. Usually, they are vague hope-filled messages, but it's weird when I blurt out something oddly specific.",

I remember having real Christmas trees from childhood, but these days with climate change, I think not chopping down a tree just to decorate it and then throw it out in a month is the more responsible thing to do.\nAri: I see. It's probably also cheaper. I'll buy an artificial one too. Do you have any suggestions for the store?\nHuman 1: Admit my favorite store is Target, plus they often have good deals.\nAri: Ah that's great. My wife also likes Target a lot.

Did you have any fun things you did?\nAri: We played pictionary. I never played before but it was a bunch of fun. what did you play?\nHuman 1: Pictionary is fun! We played office tennis. In that we take paper balls and using writing pads as rackets, two players have to work together to put the ball in a bucket kept at a distance. It was a lot of fun.\nAri: that sounds very challenging",

Good idea to help people figuring out their new year resolutions ðŸ™‚ So how do i get a fresher outlook? ðŸ™‚\nAri: Well, in my book, I took inspiration for the 24 days of Advent, and put together a workbook that you fill out each day for 24 days. It goes through accomplishments, passions, understanding, forgiveness, with each day a different theme.\nHuman 1: Wow! Sounds amazing if we practice that! I think the idea does have some potential. How did you come up with this idea?\nAri: We created a scholarship for leaders from <REDACTED_TERM> to visit an international institute at <REDACTED_TERM> for which there was no African representation.

Meaningful work life; this may mean exploring around with new stuff 3. multiple hobbies that keep you busy ... so on ðŸ™‚ What about you? is there a right answer to this? :)\nAri:  1) The idea of what it must be like to be \"on Earth as it is in Heaven\" from the Lord's prayer.

That's very thoughtful and spiritual ðŸ™‚ Also music earned a spot ðŸ™‚ yay!\nAri: Yea, I've always said that if I wrote a memoire, I would title it: \"Jazz, Jesus, and Video Games.\" Do you have a title of a book that you've thought of writing before?\nHuman 1: I am actually not much of a reader. I usually hide it by quoting john nash ~ reading books corrupts original thoughts ðŸ™‚\nAri: Thatâ€™s why you write your own books! Then itâ€™s all your thoughts on your terms :)\nHuman 1: Hehe!
