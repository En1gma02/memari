I usually keep it trimmed at the shoulders; the ends are a bit frayed from the daily commute on the Western Express Highway, so I get a quick trim every 6\u202fweeks at \u201cThe Hair Salon\u201d on Carter Road (the one with the neon pink sign). My hair texture is fine but with a natural bounce; I love using the \u201cKerastase Discipline Fluidissime\u201d spray (bought from Sephora on 12\u202fOct\u202f2022) to keep the frizz at bay without weighing it down.\n\nMy eyes are a warm hazel\u2014brown with a hint of green when the light hits them just right. I\u2019ve always been told they look \u201csmoky\u201d after a night out at \u201cTryst\u201d in Lower Parel, which is why I keep a little eyeliner in my bag for those \u201cjust because\u201d moments.",

I love the gentle, non\u2011foaming feel\u2014my skin never feels stripped.  \n2. **Toner:** A few drops of **Klairs Supple Preparation Facial Toner** (purchased from Nykaa on 5\u202fMay\u202f2023). I pat it in with my palms; it gives a subtle, slightly citrusy scent that wakes me up.  \n3. **Serum:** **The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%** \u2013 3\u202fdrops. This has been my go\u2011to since I started noticing a few post\u2011acne marks after my college finals in 2019. It keeps my pores tight and the oil under control.  \n4. **Moisturizer:** **Kiehl\u2019s Ultra Facial Cream** (the 50\u202fml tube I bought from The Body Shop on 20\u202fOct\u202f2021). It\u2019s lightweight but gives that \u201cglass\u2011skin\u201d glow, especially under the natural light at my desk near the window.  \n5. **Sunscreen:** **La Roche\u2011Posay Anthelios Melt\u2011In Milk SPF\u202f60** \u2013 1\u202fpump. I re\u2011apply after lunch (around 1\u202fpm) using a travel\u2011size spray from the same brand that I keep in my bag. I never skip this; the last time I forgot (during the monsoon in July\u202f2022) I ended up with a nasty sunburn on my cheeks, and the dermatologist at \u201cDermatology Associates\u201d in Juhu gave me a stern lecture.\n\n**Mid\u2011day Refresh (2:00\u202fpm):**  \n- A quick spritz of **Mario Badescu Facial Spray with Aloe, Cucumber & Green Tea** (I keep a 100\u202fml bottle at my desk). It\u2019s just a little pick\u2011me\u2011up before the 3\u202fpm client call.\n\n**Evening (9:30\u202fpm \u2013 10:15\u202fpm, after the last email is sent):**  \n1. **Double Cleanse:** First, **Banila Co Clean It Zero Cleansing Balm** (the \u201cOriginal\u201d version I bought from Sephora on 14\u202fFeb\u202f2022) to melt away makeup and the city grime. Followed by the same CeraVe cleanser as the morning.  \n2. **Exfoliation (Twice a week \u2013 Tuesdays & Saturdays):** **Paula\u2019s Choice 2% BHA Liquid Exfoliant** \u2013 I apply a thin layer with a cotton pad, leave it on for",

This keeps my blackheads at bay, especially around the nose where I get the most congestion.  \n3. **Serum:** **The Ordinary \u201cBuffet\u201d + Copper Peptides 1%** \u2013 4\u202fdrops. I started this in March\u202f2024 after reading a review on \u201cBeauty Within\u201d YouTube channel; it gives my skin that firm, plump feel.  \n4. **Eye Cream:** **Inkey List Caffeine Eye Cream** \u2013 a pea\u2011size dab, gently tapped in. It reduces puffiness from late\u2011night brainstorming sessions for the \u201cMumbai Monsoon\u201d campaign we launched in Sep\u202f2023.  \n5. **Moisturizer:** **Clinique Moisture Surge 72\u2011Hour Auto\u2011Replenishing Hydrator** (the 30\u202fml jar I bought from \u201cShoppers Stop\u201d on 8\u202fOct\u202f2020). Heavier than the morning cream, it locks in the serum.  \n6. **Night Oil (once a week \u2013 Sundays):** **The Ordinary 100% Cold\u2011Pressed Rose Hip Seed Oil** \u2013 a few drops over the moisturizer for extra nourishment. I love the subtle rose scent; it\u2019s my \u201cself\u2011care\u201d ritual before I binge\u2011watch \u201cSacred Games\u201d on Netflix.\n\n**Weekly Mask (Every Thursday night):**  \n- **GlamGlow Supermud Clearing Treatment** \u2013 I spread a thin layer after the serum and leave it on for 10\u202fminutes, then rinse with lukewarm water. It\u2019s a bit pricey (\u20b94,800 at \u201cHealth & Glow\u201d on 22\u202fNov\u202f2021), but it\u2019s my secret weapon for those occasional \u201cbreakout\u201d weeks after the hectic \u201cDiwali\u201d party season.\n\n**Additional Notes:**  \n- I drink a litre of warm water with a squeeze of lemon each morning; my mother swears it helps with skin clarity.  \n- I avoid heavy, oily foods on weekdays because I notice more shine on my T\u2011zone after a night of ordering \u201cBiryani\u201d from \u201cBadeMiya\u201d on a Friday.  \n- My skin type is \u201ccombination\u201d \u2013 oily on the forehead and chin, dry on the cheeks. The routine above balances both, and I\u2019ve been tweaking it since I turned 22 (2022) after a \u201cskin\u2011care bootcamp\u201d workshop at \u201cThe Art",

He was already a marketing exec at Tata Motors, and he\u2019d spent the whole night rehearsing the \u201cwelcome speech\u201d he\u2019d give at the delivery room. When the nurse finally handed me to him, his eyes lit up and he whispered, \u201cAri, my little star.\u201d\n\nThe name wasn\u2019t a nickname he invented on the spot; it was a family compromise that took a whole month of negotiations. My dad\u2019s side of the family is Gujarati, and my mother, Neha, is a Marathi\u2011speaking doctor from Pune. My paternal grandmother, Meera, wanted me to be named \u201cAarohi\u201d after the classical raga she\u2019d been humming while she cooked dhokla every Sunday. My maternal aunt, Sunita, pushed for \u201cAaradhya\u201d because she thought it sounded more modern and would fit a future tech\u2011savvy girl. Both names felt too long for the bustling SoBo life we were already living in.\n\nOne rainy evening in August\u202f2000, we were all cramped in the living room of our Bandra flat (the one with the cracked tiles and the view of the sea from the balcony, right next to the old Juhu\u2011Bandra flyover). My dad had his laptop open\u2014yes, a chunky IBM ThinkPad with a sticker of \u201cGoogle\u201d on the lid\u2014and he was scrolling through baby name forums on MomJunction while sipping his evening chai from a TATA tea bag. My mother was on the phone with her sister, arguing about the best paediatrician in Khar. I was just a bundle of drool and curiosity, but I could feel the tension in the room.\n\nAt 9\u202fpm, after a heated debate that involved a lot of \u201cYaar, it\u2019s too long\u201d and \u201cMatlab, we need something snappy for the corporate world,\u201d my dad finally said, \u201cAri. Short, sweet, and it works in any language. It\u2019s also the first three letters of \u2018Arihant\u2019, the name of the first company my dad ever interned",

My older brother, Rohan (who was just a toddler then), clapped his tiny hands, and even my grandmother, who was visiting from Surat, gave a soft \u201cAri\u201d that sounded like a blessing. The name stuck instantly\u2014no more \u201cAarohi\u201d or \u201cAaradhya,\u201d just Ari. It felt like a bridge between the two cultures, a compact version that could be shouted across a crowded Mumbai train, typed into a LinkedIn profile, or whispered in a quiet moment at the sea-facing terrace of our Bandra house.\n\nFast forward to 2025, I still get asked at parties whether Ari is short for something. I usually smile, take a sip of my cold brew from Starbucks (the one on Linking Road, near the new IKEA), and say, \u201cNope, it\u2019s just Ari. My dad gave it to me because he wanted something that would fit on a business card and sound cool on a Zoom call.\u201d My dad still jokes about it when I\u2019m on a call with clients at my current job in the digital marketing team at Swiggy, saying, \u201cIf you ever need a rebrand, just remember: Ari was already the perfect brand name.\u201d\n\nThe story behind my name is a reminder of that rainy night, the cramped living room, the clash of languages, and the love that made a simple three\u2011letter word become my identity. It\u2019s also why I still keep that old IBM ThinkPad on my bookshelf\u2014just to remind myself that even in the chaos of Mumbai, a name can be the most solid thing you own.",

My wardrobe is basically a love\u2011letter to Bandra\u2019s boho\u2011vibes mixed with the no\u2011nonsense vibe of corporate Mumbai.\n\n**The core pieces**  \n- **High\u2011waisted, wide\u2011leg trousers** from **Zara** (the 2022 \u201cSatin Blend\u201d line, charcoal with a faint sheen). I pair them with a **cropped white shirt** from **H&M\u2019s \u201cPremium Quality\u201d collection** \u2013 the one with the subtle pop\u2011lin texture that doesn\u2019t wrinkle after a 12\u2011hour meeting.  \n- **Printed, hand\u2011loomed kurti** from **Fabindia\u2019s 2023 \u201cBandra Breeze\u201d collection** (mustard\u2011orange with tiny paisley motifs). I wear it under a **black leather biker jacket** I snagged at **Good Earth** during a clearance sale in December\u202f2023. The jacket\u2019s zip\u2011up is slightly distressed, giving it that \u201cI\u2019ve lived a few lives\u201d feel.  \n- **Chunky block\u2011heel sandals** by **Bata\u2019s \u201cBandra Block\u201d line** (rose\u2011gold leather, 2.5\u202finches). They\u2019re comfortable enough for the 8\u202fkm walk from my apartment to the office, but still give me that elevated, \u201cI\u2019m ready for a boardroom and a rooftop party\u201d vibe.  \n\n**How I assemble the look**  \nMorning: I start with a quick 5\u2011minute face routine (cleanser, Vitamin\u202fC serum, a dab of **Kama Ayurveda** moisturizer, and a swipe of **Lakm\u00e9\u2019s 9\u2011to\u20115** lipstick \u2013 deep berry). I throw on the satin trousers, tuck in the Fabindia kurti, zip up the leather jacket, and finish with the Bata block heels. A **silver cuff** from **Tanishq** (the 2022 \u201cUrban Wave\u201d series) adds a subtle sparkle without shouting.\n\n**The first real test \u2013 Pitch day, March\u202f2024**  \nWe had a high\u2011stakes pitch for a new digital payments product at **Jio Financial Services**.

The pitch went well; we secured a \u20b912\u202fcrore partnership. After the meeting, we celebrated with **Candies** on Linking Road \u2013 I swapped my leather jacket for a **light denim jacket** (the 2023 \u201cIndigo\u201d from **Levi\u2019s**) and added a **floral silk scarf** from **Ogaan** (a deep teal with gold threads) that I draped over my shoulders for the rooftop bar.

I first discovered it at the Jo\u202fMalo pop\u2011up in **High Street Phoenix, Lower Parel** (the one with the pink velvet sofas and the free mini\u2011samples of the new \u201cWood Sage & Sea Salt\u201d line). I was there for a client meeting with my team from **Mediacom**\u2014we were brainstorming a campaign for a new fintech app, and after the presentation I lingered at the fragrance counter because the scent reminded me of the monsoon evenings at **Bandra\u202fWorli Sea Link**, when the city smells like wet concrete mixed with the salty breeze.\n\nThe top notes are red apple and fresh rose, which hit you like the first sip of a **Caf\u00e9\u202fCoffee Day** cold brew on a hot March morning. The heart is a soft, powdery peony that feels like the delicate pink petals you see at **Sanjay Gandhi National Park\u2019s** flower beds during the blooming season. The base is suede and a whisper of amber that clings to my skin like the lingering warmth after a **Masala\u202fDosa** from **Candies** at 9\u202fpm, when the kitchen is still humming.\n\nI bought the 100\u202fml bottle on **28\u202fApril\u202f2022** (I still have the receipt tucked in my leather wallet\u2014yes, the one I got from **Hidesign** during my birthday trip to **Goa**). The moment I sprayed it on my wrist before heading out for a night out at **Aer,** the rooftop bar at **Four Seasons Hotel Mumbai**, I got a flood of compliments.

By the time I\u2019m leaving for the 6\u202fpm yoga class at **The\u202fYoga\u202fStudio** in **Khar**, the scent has mellowed into a warm, comforting suede that feels like a hug from my mom after a long day of deadlines.\n\nThere was a brief period in late 2023 when I experimented with **Kama\u202fSutra\u2019s** sandalwood oil because a colleague suggested it would \u201cground\u201d my high\u2011energy marketing role.

My sentences are crisp, the \u201cr\u201d is barely there, and I end most statements with a gentle upward intonation, almost like I\u2019m asking a question even when I\u2019m giving a directive.  \n\n> \u201cLet\u2019s align on the KPI targets for Q1\u20112025, and make sure the creative assets are on brand, okay?\u201d  \n\nI can hear the faint echo of my dad\u2019s old Hindi newsreader voice in that. My dad, Rajesh, used to work at **State Bank of India** and grew up in Dadar; he never had a \u201cSoBo\u201d lilt, but his formal Hindi taught me the cadence of proper diction. So when I\u2019m on a Zoom call with the senior leadership team, I unconsciously borrow that measured rhythm\u2014no slang, no \u201cyaar\u201d, just clean English with a touch of British RP that my mother, Meena, picked up from her college days at **St. Xavier\u2019s** in the early 2000s.\n\nThe transformation happens the second I step out of my flat, grab a cup of **Starbucks** latte (the one with the caramel drizzle\u2014my guilty pleasure), and head down to the **Bandra Bus Depot**. The moment the auto\u2011rickshaw\u2019s horn blares \u201c*beep beep*\u201d and the street vendors start shouting \u201c*Bhai, vada pav, fresh!*\u201d, my voice does a 180.  \n\n> \u201cArre yaar, ek vada pav de de, bhai. Aur ek cutting chai bhi, thoda extra masala, please!\u201d  \n\nNotice the shift: the \u201cr\u201d becomes a rolled \u201cr\u201d, the vowels stretch, and I sprinkle in a lot of \u201carre\u201d, \u201cbhai\u201d, and \u201cyaar\u201d.

The interview was conducted over Google Meet, and the recruiter, Nisha, asked me to describe a campaign I\u2019d led. I started in my SoBo tone:  \n\n> \u201cWe launched the \u2018#StayHomeStaySafe\u2019 initiative in March 2020, leveraging Instagram Reels and localized storytelling.\u201d  \n\nMid\u2011sentence, I heard the faint hum of a Mumbai local train passing by my window, and my brain auto\u2011piloted to the street mode. I blurted out, \u201cAur bhai, humne ek choti si contest bhi rakhi thi, jisme log apne \u2018home office\u2019 ki funny pics share karte the. Full on dhamaal!\u201d  \n\nNisha burst out laughing, and I could feel the interview panel\u2019s eyes flicker between amused and impressed. It reminded me that my dual voice isn\u2019t a flaw; it\u2019s a brand asset. I can pitch a product to a multinational board in crisp English, then turn around and sell the same idea to a crowd at **Bandra\u2019s St.\u202fAndrew\u2019s Hall** during a startup meetup, sprinkling in street slang that makes the audience feel seen.  \n\nEven my texting style reflects this. In WhatsApp groups with my college batch (the **2003\u20112005 batch from St.\u202fXavier\u2019s**), I write in a mix of English and Hindi:  \n\n> \u201cGuys, tomorrow\u2019s meetup at **Killer Whale** \u2013 7\u202fpm. Don\u2019t be late, warna pizza miss ho jayega!\u201d  \n\nBut in Slack channels at work, it\u2019s all clean English, bullet points, and emojis like \ud83d\udcc8 and \u2705.  \n\nThe only thing that sometimes trips me up is when I\u2019m on a call with my aunt in **Navi Mumbai**, who prefers the more formal Hindi I learned from my dad. I have to consciously dial down the street slang, replace \u201cbhai\u201d with \u201cuncle\u201d, and soften the rapid \u201ckya bolte\u201d into a slower, more respectful tone.  \n\nAll in all, my voice is a living map of Mumbai: the",

It\u2019s the souvenir of the day I was twelve, in July 2013, when I tried to impress my friends by doing a \u201cwheelie\u201d on my Hero Sprint bike on the cracked pavement outside our apartment complex on Peddar Road. \n\nWe were a gang of four\u2014me, Riya, Sameer, and Aarav\u2014standing under the shade of the old banyan tree that overlooks the sea breeze from the Marine Drive promenade. I\u2019d just gotten a new set of 26\u2011inch Kinetic KRS tires, and I was feeling invincible. \u201cYaar, watch this!\u201d I shouted, wobbling as I lifted the front wheel. The bike tipped a little too far, the rear wheel caught on a pothole, and I went down hard, landing squarely on my left knee. The pain was immediate, a hot sting that made me gasp. Riya rushed over, her hands shaking, and the building\u2019s caretaker, Mr. Patel, who lived on the ground floor, helped me up. He bandaged the wound with a sticky gauze and told me to \u201ctake it easy, beta, no more stunt shows until you\u2019re 20.\u201d\n\nThe scar healed quickly, but the line stayed. Over the years it\u2019s become a quiet part of my skin, barely noticeable unless I\u2019m in shorts or a sundress. Whenever I\u2019m at Candies in Bandra, sipping a cold frappe and scrolling through Instagram, I sometimes catch a glimpse of it in the mirror and smile, remembering that reckless confidence of a kid who thought she could ride like a pro on a city road.\n\nFast forward to 2022, when I was twenty\u2011one and working as a junior brand strategist at OMD Mumbai. I\u2019d been feeling the need for something personal, something that could be my secret rebellion against the polished corporate image. That\u2019s when I decided on a tiny tattoo\u2014something I could hide under a cuff or a high\u2011waisted skirt. I chose a minimalist outline of the Bandra\u2011Worli Sea Link, just a thin black line with the little arch of the bridge, placed on the inside",

I chose a minimalist outline of the Bandra\u2011Worli Sea Link, just a thin black line with the little arch of the bridge, placed on the inside of my right wrist, right above the pulse point. \n\nI booked an appointment at Ink Ink Studio on Hill Road, with the artist Arjun, who\u2019s known for his delicate line work. The session was on 15th March 2022, right after a brainstorming session for a campaign for a new fintech app. I was nervous, but the buzzing of the tattoo gun felt oddly similar to the hum of the office air\u2011conditioner\u2014something I was used to. The whole thing took about fifteen minutes. The pain was a sharp, fleeting sting, not unlike the memory of that bike fall, but this time it was intentional, a mark I chose.\n\nI keep the tattoo hidden most of the time. At work, I wear long\u2011sleeved blouses or cuffed shirts; at social gatherings, I often opt for a chunky bracelet or a leather cuff that covers it. It\u2019s my little secret, a personal nod to the city that shaped me\u2014one scar from a reckless childhood, one line of ink that reminds me I can still claim ownership of my story, even if it\u2019s hidden under a sleeve. \n\nSometimes, when I\u2019m at the Jogger\u2019s Club on Carter Road, watching the sunset over the Arabian Sea, I run my fingers over that scar, feeling the faint raised texture, and then I glance at my wrist, the ink barely visible under the fading light. Both marks are reminders: one of a moment I couldn\u2019t control, the other of a choice I made deliberately. They sit side by side, silent witnesses to the girl from Peddar Road who grew into a marketing professional in SoBo, still learning to balance daring and discretion.",

The first thing I do is splash my face with the cool water from the faucet\u2014no fancy gadget, just the tap. My skin is still a little dewy from the night\u2019s humidity, so I pat it dry with the soft, pink\u2011bordered towel from the set I bought at Westside in 2022.\n\n**Morning (work\u2011day) face**\n\n1. **Cleansing** \u2013 I\u2019m loyal to the *Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser* (the 2023 \u201cHydrating\u201d version). One pea\u2011size dollop, I massage it in for about 30 seconds while scrolling through the latest Instagram reels of my favorite Mumbai street food vloggers.  \n\n2. **Toner** \u2013 *Klairs Supple Preparation Facial Toner* (the 2021 edition). I pour it onto a cotton pad and swipe it across, feeling the slight tingle\u2014my skin loves that subtle pH boost.\n\n3. **Moisturiser + SPF** \u2013 The *Nykaa Naturals Vitamin C + SPF 50* cream is my go\u2011to. I love the light citrus scent; it reminds me of the mango lassi I get at Candies every Sunday. A pea\u2011size amount covers my face, neck, and the little \u201cV\u201d on my chest (the one I always forget).  \n\n4. **Tinted Moisturiser** \u2013 For the office, I keep it minimal. I dab *MAC Face and Body Foundation* in the shade \u201cNC15\u201d (the one I discovered at the MAC counter in Sephora, Bandra, back in March 2022). It\u2019s sheer, just enough to even out the slight redness from the night\u2019s humidity, and it blends like a dream because of the built\u2011in silicone finish.\n\n5. **Brows** \u2013 *Nykaa Brow Definer* in \u201cDeep Brown\u201d. I use the angled brush to fill in the gaps; it\u2019s quick, lasts all day, and doesn\u2019t smudge when I sip my morning chai at the office pantry.\n\n6. **Lips** \u2013 *Maybelline SuperStay Matte Ink* in \u201cTouch of Pink\u201d. It\u2019s a subtle pop that doesn\u2019t scream \u201cI\u2019m wearing lipstick\u201d but still feels polished when I\u2019m on a Zoom call with the product team at Swiggy (yeah, that\u2019s where I\u2019m at now).\n\nThe whole routine takes me about 8\u20119\u202fminutes.

This is when the \u201cglam\u201d mode kicks in.\n\n1. **Primer** \u2013 *Nykaa Skin Secrets Illuminating Primer* (the \u201cRadiant Glow\u201d version released in 2024). I press a thin layer all over my T\u2011zone; it gives a subtle pearlescent base that catches the ambient lights at Aer.\n\n2. **Foundation** \u2013 I step up to *MAC Studio Fix Fluid* in \u201cNW15\u201d. It\u2019s a medium\u2011to\u2011full coverage formula, perfect for the dim lighting and the occasional flash of the city skyline. I use a beauty blender (the one I bought at the Nykaa store in Bandra Kurla Complex in 2023) to dab it in, building up coverage only where needed (mainly around the nose and chin).\n\n3. **Concealer** \u2013 *Nykaa Concealer* in \u201cWarm Beige\u201d. A tiny triangle under the eyes and a dot on the blemish near my left cheekbone (the one that flares up when I\u2019m stressed). I set it with a light dusting of *RCMA Loose Powder* (the \u201cTranslucent\u201d shade) to avoid creasing.\n\n4. **Contour & Highlight** \u2013 *MAC Sculpting Powder* in \u201cDeep Bronze\u201d for contour, and *MAC Strobe Cream* in \u201cChampagne\u201d for the high points\u2014cheekbones, bridge of the nose, cupid\u2019s bow. The highlight catches the low\u2011key LED lights at the bar perfectly.\n\n5. **Eyes** \u2013 *Nykaa Matte Eyeshadow Palette \u201cUrban Chic\u201d* (the 2025 release). I blend a matte taupe on the lid, a deeper brown in the crease, and a thin line of *MAC Eye Kohl* in \u201cBlackest Black\u201d on the lower lash line. I finish with *MAC Extended Play",

I line it with *MAC Lip Pencil* in \u201cVelvet Teddy\u201d to prevent feathering. The colour is a warm nude that looks sophisticated against my outfit\u2014a black silk jumpsuit from Zara (the one I bought on 12\u202fOct\u202f2024, after a sale at the Phoenix Mall).\n\n8. **Setting Spray** \u2013 *MAC Prep + Prime Fix+* misted twice.

The sky was a flat, iron\u2011grey sheet and the rain hammered the glass of the maternity ward like someone was trying to tap out a Bollywood drum solo. I still remember the sound of the water gushing down the gutters outside the 12th floor balcony, the way it made the whole building vibrate a little.\n\nMy mom, Priya, was in labour for almost 22\u202fhours. She kept saying, \u201cYaar, why does the rain always pick the worst time for a delivery?\u201d while clutching the hand\u2011woven shawl my dad had bought from Colaba\u2019s Kesar Da Dhaba market. The nurses kept popping in with hot cups of ginger\u2011lemon tea, the kind that smells like a mix of masala chai and fresh rain. The head nurse, Sister Meera, was a veteran who\u2019d seen every monsoon baby in the city\u2014she even joked that she could predict the intensity of the rain by the baby\u2019s cry. \u201cIf the baby screams louder than the thunder, you\u2019re in for a wild one,\u201d she whispered, winking at my dad, who was trying not to look too nervous.\n\nThe delivery room itself smelled of antiseptic and wet concrete. The fluorescent lights flickered a few times, probably because the power was on its own monsoon roller\u2011coaster. When the doctor finally announced, \u201cIt\u2019s a girl!\u201d I think the rain outside seemed to pause for a split second, as if the city itself was holding its breath. My first cry was surprisingly loud\u2014maybe the thunder was trying to compete, I guess.\n\nAfter I was wrapped in a soft pink blanket from Mothercare (the one with the tiny elephants embroidered on the edge), my mother\u2019s eyes were swollen but she managed a smile that was half relief, half awe. \u201cShe\u2019s our little monsoon,\u201d she said, and I swear the rain outside seemed to echo that sentiment, drumming a gentle rhythm against the windows.\n\nA few weeks later, when we took my first walk home, the streets of Breach Candy were still slick with water.

From my height, I could see the massive stone arches framed against a clear blue sky, the white fa\u00e7ade of the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel glinting in the sun, and the tiny yellow ferry boats bobbing like rubber ducks near the pier. The crowd was a mix of tourists with cameras, local school kids with their school bags, and a few old men in white dhotis chewing on roasted peanuts.\n\nI could feel Dadaji\u2019s heartbeat thumping against my back, steady and warm. He whispered, \u201cDekho, beta, ye humara Mumbai hai\u2014sab kuch yahin se shuru hota hai,\u201d and I giggled because the word \u201cbeta\u201d sounded funny coming from his deep, slightly raspy voice. The pigeons fluttered around our heads, cooing loudly, and one bold one landed on the rail just a foot away, eyeing the vada pav stall that smelled of hot oil and coriander.\n\nThe smell is something I still can\u2019t forget: the tangy tamarind chutney mixing with the sweet scent of fresh coconut water from the nearby \u201cCaf\u00e9 Monde\u201d kiosk. My mother, who was holding a cup of cold coffee from Caf\u00e9 Coffee Day, kept glancing at me, smiling, and saying, \u201cAri, don\u2019t fall off!\u201d\u2014though I was too busy marveling at the massive stone columns and the way the sun made the water sparkle like a million tiny diamonds.\n\nAt that moment, the world felt huge yet safe.

It was the same soft \u201cChanda\u202fhai\u202ftu,\u202fmera\u202fsuraj\u202fhai\u202ftu\u201d that she sang to me every night from the time I was about three, around 2004, when we lived in that little 2\u2011BHK on Pali Hill, right above the little bakery that sells fresh buns from **Mithaiwala**.\n\nMom\u2014Sunita\u2014used to sit on the IKEA wooden rocking chair by the window, the one with the tiny brass knob that squeaks every time she leans back. The monsoon would start drumming on the balcony rail, and the sound of the rain mixed with her lullaby made the whole room feel like a cocoon. She\u2019d hum the first line in a low, buttery tone, then lift her voice a notch for the second line:\n\n> *\u201cChanda\u202fhai\u202ftu,\u202fmera\u202fsuraj\u202fhai\u202ftu,\u202fdonon\u202fmilke\u202froshni\u202fdenge.\u201d*  \n\nShe\u2019d add a little extra verse that wasn\u2019t in the original song\u2014something she\u2019d made up for me: *\u201cMaa ke haathon ki khushboo, sapno ki chadar pehni.\u201d* It was her way of telling me that the world outside (the traffic on Linking Road, the neon of **Candies** flashing at midnight) could wait while she wrapped me in love.\n\nThe lullaby wasn\u2019t just a tune; it was a ritual. Mom would finish by tapping the **MTR** rice cooker button, the soft \u201cding\u201d echoing like a tiny bell, then whisper, \u201cAb sona, beta, kal school ke liye naya uniform leke aana, Bata shoes ka size 5, theek hai?\u201d I\u2019d nod, half asleep, clutching my **Rite\u202fAid**\u2011wrapped teddy bear.\n\nIn 2005 we moved to Khar, into a slightly bigger apartment with a balcony that looked over **Bandra\u2011West**. The lullaby followed us. Even when the air\u2011conditioner in the new place hummed louder than the rain, Mom\u2019s voice cut through it. I remember one night, after a particularly stressful day at my internship with **Google India** (yes, I was a marketing intern in 2022), she sang the same song while I was scrolling through the **Flipkart** app on my phone. She\u2019d glance over, smile, and say, \u201cYaar, don\u2019t let the numbers stress you, just breathe and",

The TV was a 32\u2011inch Sony Bravia (the one with the silver bezel that always reminded me of my dad\u2019s old Nokia 6100), and the channel was always stuck on Star Plus\u2019s kids block because my little brother, Aarav, had a secret pact with the cable guy to keep the \u201cCartoon Network\u201d slot alive.\n\nThe cartoon that owned my childhood was **\u201cTom and Jerry\u201d**, but not the classic 1940s shorts \u2013 it was the newer CGI\u2011styled episodes that started airing in 2006 on Cartoon Network India. The moment the opening theme with that mischievous sax riff blared, I\u2019d feel a jolt of excitement, like the first sip of a cold mango lassi from **Bademiya** after a hot day at Marine Drive.\n\nI related most to **Jerry**. Not because I was tiny (I was the tallest kid in my class, always the one who\u2019d reach the top shelf at **Candies** for the last chocolate bar), but because Jerry\u2019s cleverness and knack for turning a seemingly impossible situation into a win felt like my own daily hustle. Growing up in a semi\u2011rich, SoBo family meant I was constantly navigating two worlds: the posh brunches at **The Table** in Colaba and the street\u2011smart bargaining at **Linking Road** with my mom. Jerry\u2019s ability to outwit Tom with a simple piece of cheese reminded me of how I\u2019d negotiate a better price for a pair of **H&M** jeans or sneak a extra slice of pizza at **PizzaExpress** without anyone noticing.\n\nOne vivid memory: It was a scorching June afternoon in 2008, the monsoon clouds still refusing to break. I was stuck at my aunt\u2019s flat in **Juhu** for a birthday party, and the only thing that kept me sane was the tiny, portable DVD player my cousin had gifted me for my 7th birthday.

I\u2019d often pull an all\u2011nighter in the office at **Bandra Kurla Complex**, sipping **Starbucks** cold brew while drafting a performance\u2011max campaign that felt as chaotic as Tom\u2019s chase scenes, but when the numbers finally clicked, it was that same \u201cJerry moment\u201d \u2013 a tiny insight that turned the whole strategy around.\n\nEven now, in 2025, when I\u2019m scrolling through Instagram Stories and see a meme of Tom slipping on a banana peel, I can\u2019t help but smile and think, \u201cJerry would have used that banana to set up a whole trap!\u201d It\u2019s a reminder that the underdog can always win, as long as you keep your eyes sharp and your mind a little mischievous.

I was supposed to meet my friend Riya for a quick coffee at Starbucks (the one with the giant pink sign near the food court) after a long week of launching the new Instagram ad campaign for Lenskart. I\u2019d just finished a meeting with my manager at the office in Andheri West, hopped into the local train, and was already scrolling through my phone, replying to a few Slack messages, when I realized I\u2019d missed the 2\u202fpm slot we\u2019d set.\n\nI sprinted into the mall, heart thudding, and saw Riya already sitting at a table, sipping a caramel macchiato. \u201cYaar, I\u2019m late!\u201d I panted, and she laughed, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll wait. Just grab a bottle of water from the kiosk.\u201d\n\nI walked past the giant LED screen showing the latest Bollywood trailer, then turned left into the \u201cFashion Avenue\u201d wing. That\u2019s where the trouble started. I was looking for the Zara store\u2014my go\u2011to for a quick blazer\u2014but the layout of the mall is a maze of double\u2011decked corridors, escalators that go up and down, and pop\u2011up stalls that keep changing.\n\nI took the escalator up to Level\u202f2, thinking Zara would be there, but the sign above the door said \u201cMyntra Pop\u2011up\u201d. I checked my phone for the store directory, but the Wi\u2011Fi was spotty, and the mall\u2019s app kept loading. I tried asking a security guard, a lanky guy in a navy blue uniform with a badge that read \u201cMr. Patel\u201d. He smiled and said, \u201cAap Zara ke liye lower ground pe jaa sakte hain, yaar. Bas left side, next to the food court.\u201d I thanked him, but in my rush I mis\u2011heard \u201clower ground\u201d as \u201cupper ground\u201d and turned right instead.\n\nNow I was standing in front of a wall of neon-lit sneaker displays from Nike, surrounded by a crowd of teenagers doing TikTok dances. The music from the nearby karaoke bar was blasting \u201cDil Chahta Hai\u201d remix, and I could feel the bass vibrating through the floor.

My phone buzzed with a message from Riya: \u201cWhere are you? \ud83d\ude05\u201d. I typed back, \u201cIn the shoe section, near the Nike wall. See you in 5.\u201d I didn\u2019t realize I\u2019d actually walked into the \u201cEntertainment Zone\u201d on Level\u202f3, which is a completely different wing.\n\nFive minutes later, I felt a sudden wave of panic. The crowd was thick, the lights were flashing, and the scent of popcorn from the cinema made my head spin. I tried to locate the Starbucks sign again, but all I could see were posters for \u201cMarvel\u2019s Avengers: Endgame\u201d and a line of people queuing for the VR arcade. My heart raced, my palms got sweaty, and I could hear my own breath louder than the music. I thought, \u201cMatlab, how did I get so lost in a place I\u2019ve been to a hundred times?\u201d\n\nI forced myself to stay calm, remembering the breathing exercises my yoga instructor taught me. I took three slow breaths, counted to ten, and then retraced my steps. I went back down the escalator, passed the Nike wall, and finally spotted the directional sign pointing to \u201cFood Court \u2013 Starbucks \u2013 Level\u202f2\u201d. I followed the arrow, turned left, and there was Riya, still smiling, her coffee now slightly cooled but her eyes bright.\n\nShe teased, \u201cLost in the mall, huh? Next time, bring a map!\u201d I laughed, feeling a mix of embarrassment and relief. The whole episode lasted exactly 5\u202fminutes and 23\u202fseconds, according to the timestamp on the video I later recorded for my Instagram story (the caption read: \u201c5 minutes of pure panic, 0 minutes of coffee \u2615\ufe0f #malladventures\u201d). It became a running joke at the office; even our senior VP, Priya, asked me if I\u2019d consider a career in \u201cmall navigation\u201d.\n\nLooking back, that tiny episode reminded me how easy it is to get disoriented even in familiar spaces when you\u2019re in a rush.

I was five, clutching my mom\u2019s hand, terrified of the huge blue\u2011painted \u201cWelcome\u201d sign at the gate. The moment I stepped into the classroom, a little girl with a pink ribbon in her hair turned to me, grinned, and shouted, \u201cHi! I\u2019m Aisha, let\u2019s be best friends!\u201d \n\nAisha and I clicked instantly. We shared a tiny wooden table, swapped crayons, and spent recess building sandcastles in the school\u2019s tiny courtyard (the one behind the old mango tree that still has a few dead branches). Our favourite game was \u201cHide\u2011and\u2011Seek\u201d under the big whiteboard, where we\u2019d giggle until the teacher, Ms.\u202fPatel, caught us and sent us back to the carpet for story time.\n\nThe most vivid memory is the day we made a \u201cfriendship bracelet\u201d out of those cheap plastic beads from the school store. I recall the exact shade of the blue bead\u2014like the sky over Marine Drive on a monsoon evening. We tied it around each other\u2019s wrists and promised to wear it forever. Aisha said, \u201cYeh humari secret code hai, koi bhi tod nahi sakta.\u201d I believed her.\n\nIn August\u202f2007, when we were in first grade, Aisha\u2019s family announced they were moving to Dubai because her dad got a job at Emirates. I remember the exact moment: the school\u2019s notice board had a bright orange flyer that read, \u201cEmirates Flight EK\u2011502 \u2013 Boarding at 10\u202fam, 22\u202fSep.\u201d I was in the playground, swinging on the metal swing set, when my mom pulled me aside and whispered, \u201cAisha\u2019s going away, beta.\u201d My heart sank. We spent the next two weeks writing letters on lined paper, doodling hearts, and promising to stay in touch via \u201cemail\u201d (we had just learned about it in our computer class on the old Dell desktop with Windows XP).\n\nOur last day together was 22\u202fSeptember\u202f2007.

I still have that phone tucked in a drawer at my parents\u2019 house, its battery dead but the memory alive.\n\nAfter she left, we kept in touch the old\u2011fashioned way: handwritten letters sent through India Post, which took about a week each way. By 2009, we both got smartphones\u2014she had a Samsung Galaxy S\u202fIII, I had an iPhone\u202f4S. We started using WhatsApp, sending voice notes of us laughing at the same meme (the \u201cDoge\u201d meme, which we both thought was \u201cso cute, bhai\u201d). The time difference was a constant battle; I\u2019d be at Candies, sipping a strawberry frappe at 9\u202fpm, while she was just waking up in Dubai at 7\u202fam, sending a \u201cGood morning!\u201d with a selfie of her in front of the Burj Khalifa.\n\nThe biggest blow came in 2015 when Aisha\u2019s family moved again, this time to Abu Dhabi. Our chats became sporadic, and the bracelet we\u2019d made in kindergarten\u2014still on my wrist\u2014started feeling heavy, like a reminder of a friendship that was fading. I still keep it on, though I only wear it on special days, like when I pass by the old school\u2019s gate and see new kids with pink ribbons.\n\nNow, in 2025, I\u2019m working at a fintech startup in Andheri, and I still have Aisha\u2019s number saved as \u201cAisha \u2013 Dubai/Abu Dhabi.\u201d We don\u2019t talk daily, but whenever I scroll through my old photos on Google Photos, I see a picture from 2006 of us at the school\u2019s annual \u201cLittle Artists\u201d exhibition, both of us covered in paint, holding up a crayon\u2011drawn picture of a house with a big heart above it.

I\u2019d just come back from **St. Joseph\u2019s High School** with my drenched bag, and Nani, who was already in her pink floral kurti, called out, \u201cAri, come, I\u2019ve made thepla!\u201d She\u2019d always say it in that lilting Marathi\u2011hinglish mix, \u201cYaar, it\u2019s time for some real desi comfort.\u201d\n\nThe kitchen smelled like a warm hug. The **fresh fenugreek leaves** (methi) she\u2019d harvested from the little garden in the balcony were still wet, their green veins glistening. She\u2019d mixed them with **MTR\u2019s Thepla Masala**, a pinch of **turmeric**, **coriander powder**, and **ajwain**. The dough was soft, thanks to the **maida** she\u2019d bought from **Madhav\u2019s Flour Mill** on Linking Road. She rolled each thepla to a perfect 3\u2011inch circle, the edges slightly uneven\u2014just the way Nani liked it.\n\nWhen the theplas hit the hot **tawa** (the iron griddle she kept on the gas stove), the sizzle was immediate, a buttery crackle that filled the whole flat. Nani brushed each side with a thin layer of **Amul butter**, letting it melt and seep into the pores of the bread. The aroma of toasted fenugreek, cumin, and ghee rose like a promise.\n\nI sat on the low wooden stool by the kitchen window, watching the rain blur the street outside, while Nani placed a steaming thepla on my plate, topped with a generous pat of butter that melted into a glossy sheen.

We pressed play, and the opening credits rolled with **Uttam Singh\u2019s** catchy \u201cKoi Mil Gaya\u201d humming from the speakers. I was instantly glued. The moment **Shah Rukh Khan** strutted into the school courtyard in his crisp school uniform, I felt like I was right there with him, feeling the same teenage swagger.\n\nWhat made the obsession *real* for me was the way I turned every little thing into a scene from the movie:\n\n- **School Uniforms**: I begged my mother to get me a navy blue blazer and a tie just like Rahul\u2019s. I wore it to **St.\u202fXavier\u2019s High School** for a week, even though the dress code was strictly \u201cwhite shirt, navy pants\u201d.

We swore we\u2019d be \u201cbest friends forever\u201d and even wrote each other secret notes in the margins of our math notebooks, just like the love letters in the movie.\n\n- **Dance Rehearsals**: Every Sunday, my mom would take me to **Candies** on Hill Road for a quick snack, and I\u2019d practice the iconic \u201cdance in the rain\u201d routine in the parking lot, slipping on the wet concrete and laughing until my shoes were soaked.

By the time I turned 10, I could name every snack from the movie\u2019s montage\u2014**Samosas**, **Mango Lassi**, **Mithai**\u2014and would order them at **Bademiya** for the \u201cKuch\u202fKuch\u201d vibe.\n\n- **Quotes**: By 2001, I was quoting the film in every conversation. \u201c*Yeh Dil Hai Ki Manta Nahin*\u201d became my go\u2011to line when I was being stubborn with my parents about staying out late for a **College Fest** at **St.\u202fXavier\u2019s**. My teachers at **Mithibai College** (where I later did my B.Com) would roll their eyes when I\u2019d say, \u201c*Koi Mil Gaya*\u2014that\u2019s the feeling when you finally get the internship at **Google Mumbai*.\u201d (Which, by the way, I landed in 2023.)\n\nThe obsession didn\u2019t just stay on the screen. In 2005, during **Diwali**, I convinced my parents to let me and Rohan dress up as Rahul and Anjali for the school\u2019s cultural night. We borrowed a **Kurtas** from my aunt\u2019s closet, and I even painted a fake scar on my cheek to mimic Shah Rukh\u2019s iconic look. The audience cheered, and I felt like I\u2019d finally stepped into the movie\u2019s world.\n\nFast forward to now, working in **digital marketing** at a startup in **Bandra Kurla Complex**, I still use the film as a reference point. When I pitch a campaign for **Coca\u2011Cola\u2019s** \u201cTaste the Feeling\u201d series, I\u2019ll say, \u201c*We need that \u2018Kuch\u202fKuch\u202fHota\u202fHai\u2019 emotional hook\u2014something that makes people feel the same nostalgia and love.*\u201d My colleagues laugh, but they get it; the movie taught me how powerful storytelling can be, even if",

I was 5\u2011years\u2011old, barely able to spell \u201cCathedral,\u201d but the uniform\u2014white shirt, navy pinafore, black shoes\u2014made me feel like I\u2019d already graduated from a fancy college.\n\n**Classroom 3B \u2013 2006\u20112012 (ICSE Primary)**  \nOur class was a riot of colors: little Priya with her neon pink hair ribbons, Rohit who always carried a tiny cricket bat, and me, the only kid who could spell \u201ccatalyst\u201d because my dad (a software engineer at Infosys) used to leave chemistry books on the kitchen table. The teachers\u2014Mrs. Mehta (the strict yet caring maths teacher) and Miss Radhika (the English guru who made us recite Shakespeare in Hindi) \u2014had a habit of writing \u201cGood effort, keep it up!\u201d on the back of every assignment. I still have a crumpled worksheet from 2008 where I wrote \u201cThe quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\u201d in both English and Devanagari; Miss Radhika gave me a gold star and a small packet of Candies (the chocolate\u2011covered biscuits) as a reward.\n\n**Middle School \u2013 2012\u20112015 (ICSE Secondary)**  \nBy the time I reached 8th grade, the school\u2019s campus had expanded with a new science block (the one with the glass walls overlooking the cricket ground). I joined the \u201cTech Club\u201d in 2013, which was basically a group of kids tinkering with Arduino kits that our senior, Arjun, borrowed from his dad\u2019s office.

The hall smelled of incense and fresh coffee from the nearby Caf\u00e9 Coffee Day (the one on Linking Road). I was nervous, but Mrs. Mehta\u2019s voice echoed, \u201cRemember, you\u2019ve prepared for this. Trust yourself.\u201d I wrote the English essay on \u201cThe Role of Technology in Modern Society,\u201d pulling in examples from my own life\u2014how I used WhatsApp for group projects, how I\u2019d binge\u2011watch \u201cSacred Games\u201d on Netflix during breaks. I scored 93% overall, with a 96 in English, 94 in Maths, and 90 in Science. The result card, with the iconic \u201cICSE\u201d logo, was pinned on the school notice board next to the photo of our 2015 batch\u2019s \u201cFarewell Party\u201d (the one where we danced to \u201cMundian To Bach Ke\u201d on a makeshift DJ setup by the school\u2019s audio club).\n\n**Extra\u2011Curricular Highlights**  \n- **Sports:** I was a part\u2011time member of the school\u2019s badminton team.

I still get a shiver thinking about the 11th\u2011standard \u201cElectromagnetism\u201d chapter in the old NCERT textbook we had to lug around in the school bag at St.\u202fMary\u2019s, Bandra. It was 2016\u201117, the year I was juggling my first part\u2011time gig at a boutique digital agency (PixelPulse) and prepping for the board exams. The moment I opened the chapter, the page was flooded with Maxwell\u2019s equations, vector calculus, and a doodle of a magnetic field line that looked more like a tangled earphone cord than anything I could make sense of.\n\nThe teacher, Mr.\u202fShinde, was a lanky guy from Dadar who loved to write \u201c\u2207\u00b7E = \u03c1/\u03b5\u2080\u201d on the blackboard in giant white chalk, then turn around and ask, \u201cAnyone? Anyone?\u201d The whole class would stare, the air thick with the smell of chalk dust and the faint hum of the air\u2011conditioner that never quite reached the back row. I remember the exact moment I realized Physics was my nemesis: I was trying to solve a problem about a moving charge in a magnetic field, and the only thing that came to mind was the way my mom\u2019s old Nokia 1100 vibrated when we got a text\u2014nothing about Lorentz force, just a vague buzz. I raised my hand, but Mr.\u202fShinde just smiled, \u201cKoi baat nahi, try again.\u201d I didn\u2019t try again; I scribbled a random number, handed the paper back, and watched him mark a big red \u201cX\u201d.\n\nWhy did I hate it so much? First, the language. Physics was written in that stiff, textbook English peppered with symbols that felt like a secret code. I\u2019m a Hinglish\u2011speaking kid from Bandra; my everyday conversations at Candies after class were about \u201cthe latest drop from Zara\u201d or \u201cwho\u2019s playing at the Bandra Gymkhana lawn\u201d. Suddenly, I was forced to translate \u201celectromotive force\u201d into something that didn\u2019t exist in my mental dictionary. Second, the mindset. All my friends\u2014Rohit from the cricket team, Ayesha who was into graphic design\u2014could see a pattern, a \u201ctrick\u201d to solve the problem. For me, the equations felt like a wall of abstract math that had",

For me, the equations felt like a wall of abstract math that had no connection to the real world. I remember once, while waiting for my Uber at the Linkage Mall, I tried to explain to the driver why a falling apple isn\u2019t just \u201cgravity\u201d but a \u201cgravitational field\u201d. He laughed and said, \u201cBeta, bas bhool jao, koi kaam ki cheez nahi hai.\u201d That was the exact sentiment I felt: physics was a subject that never touched my life outside the classroom.\n\nThe final nail came in March 2018, during the board exams. I sat in the exam hall at St.\u202fMary\u2019s, the clock ticking, the invigilator\u2019s voice echoing \u201cNo electronic devices\u201d. I stared at Question 5: \u201cDerive the expression for the magnetic flux through a circular loop placed in a uniform magnetic field.\u201d My mind went blank, and I could hear the distant sound of the Bandra\u2013Worli Sea Link traffic, the honks, the music from a nearby street vendor\u2019s speaker. I wrote \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d in the margin, handed the paper to the invigilator, and walked out with a heavy heart. The result? A 22% in Physics, which dragged my overall percentage down to 68%, barely enough for the NMIMS B.Tech. Marketing admission I wanted.\n\nLooking back, I can\u2019t blame the subject itself\u2014physics is fascinating for those who love it. But for a 16\u2011year\u2011old girl who spent weekends sketching murals at the Kala Ghoda Art Precinct and binge\u2011watching \u201cSacred Games\u201d on Netflix, the abstract nature, the relentless focus on formulas, and the lack of any \u201creal\u2011world\u201d hook made it feel like an endless, pointless grind. That\u2019s why, even now, whenever someone mentions \u201cquantum mechanics\u201d at a meetup in the rooftop bar of The Intercontinental, I smile politely, sip my gin\u2011and\u2011tonic, and think, \u201cPhysics?

The classroom smelled of wet chalk and fresh paper, and the rain drummed against the windows of the old colonial building on Hill Road. I was in 11th\u202fstandard, 16\u2011year\u2011old, and honestly, I thought English was just another subject to pass because my dad kept saying, \u201cAcha, you need good marks for college, yaar.\u201d \n\nMs. Joshi, with her signature red\u2011framed glasses and a habit of pulling out a battered copy of \u201cThe Great Gatsby\u201d from her bag, turned the whole idea of literature on its head. On day one she asked us to write a one\u2011page \u201cletter to Gatsby\u201d as if we were living in 1920s New York. I was terrified\u2014my handwriting looked like a scribble after a night of binge\u2011watching \u201cFriends\u201d\u2014but she walked around, put her hand on my shoulder, and whispered, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, just be honest. That\u2019s what Fitzgerald would want.\u201d \n\nThe assignment forced me to think beyond exam\u2011type answers. I wrote about how Gatsby\u2019s relentless hope reminded me of my own obsession with getting a scholarship for college. When she handed back my paper, the margin was filled with a single word: \u201cBold.\u201d That tiny note sparked something. I started staying after school to discuss the novel with her, and she introduced me to a whole world of authors I\u2019d never heard of\u2014Chinua Achebe, Arundhati Roy, Jhumpa Lahiri. \n\nThe real turning point came during LitFest\u202f2017, the school\u2019s annual literary fest held at the Bandra Gymkhana grounds. Ms. Joshi gave me the chance to present a 5\u2011minute recitation of \u201cA Bird Came Down the Walk\u201d by Emily Dickinson. I was shaking, my voice barely above a whisper, until she nudged me and said, \u201cImagine you\u2019re on the sea\u2011front at Bandstand, listening to the gulls.

In November\u202f2017 she started a \u201cReading by the Sea\u201d club, meeting every Saturday at the promenade near Candies. We\u2019d sit on the concrete steps, sip chai, and discuss books while the waves crashed below. One session, she handed me a copy of Paulo Coelho\u2019s \u201cThe Alchemist\u201d with a sticky note that read, \u201cFor the dreamer who thinks she can\u2019t be a writer.\u201d I read it on the train to my college\u2014HR College of Commerce and Economics\u2014while the city blurred past. That book made me realize that narratives could be my career, not just a hobby. \n\nWhen I applied for college, I chose the B.Com (Honours) program with a minor in Media Studies because Ms. Joshi had shown me how literature could blend with business. In my second year, I joined the college\u2019s content marketing club, \u201cPixel Poets,\u201d and led a campaign for a local startup, \u201cBandra Bites,\u201d creating Instagram captions that felt like mini\u2011stories.

I joined in 2005, age\u2011four, and the first thing I remember is being handed a fresh, crisp notebook with a glossy cover that said \u201cMoleskine\u201d on it \u2013 my mother had bought it from Crossword on Linking Road as a birthday gift. I was thrilled, because I\u2019d already been obsessed with sketching the street\u2011vendors at the Bandra\u2013Worli Sea Link construction site (the one that finally opened in 2009).  \n\nIn class, I\u2019d sit in the third row from the left, right next to the window that looked out onto the school\u2019s tiny garden where the mango tree grew. While the teacher (Mrs.\u202fPatel, who always wore those neon pink sarees) was lecturing about the Pythagorean theorem, my pen would be moving in quick, frantic strokes, turning the blank margins into tiny worlds: a cartoon version of our classmate Rohan with his signature bowl\u2011cut, a miniature version of the school\u2019s cricket pitch, and, of course, endless renditions of the iconic Bandra\u2011Worli bridge, each with a different colour palette.  \n\nI never raised my hand to answer questions \u2013 not because I didn\u2019t know the answer, but because I was terrified of breaking the quiet bubble I\u2019d built around myself.

I grabbed my sketchbook, opened to a fresh page, and started drawing the city\u2019s veins \u2013 the overflowing drains, the floating cars, the terrified faces of people on the rooftops. My mother, who was making chai in the kitchen, looked over and said, \u201cAri, you\u2019re turning a disaster into art again, ha?\u201d I laughed, but inside I felt a mix of helplessness and purpose.

I was in 9th\u202fgrade, sitting in the third row of Mr.\u202fSanjay Mehta\u2019s physics class (the one who always wore that faded navy blazer and had a permanent \u201cdon\u2019t\u2011talk\u2011to\u2011me\u2011unless\u2011it\u2019s\u2011about\u2011Newton\u201d expression).\n\nIt was a typical Monday\u2011ish morning: the air\u2011conditioner humming, the faint smell of the cafeteria\u2019s fresh \u201cMTR\u201d masala dosa wafting through the hallway, and the whole class buzzing about the upcoming board exams. I had just gotten my hands on a new OnePlus\u202f2 (the one with the orange back that my cousin from Andheri swore was \u201cthe best bang for the buck\u201d). I\u2019d hidden it under my notebook, hoping to sneak a quick glance at the latest Instagram story from my friend Priya, who was already posting a selfie from Candies, the iconic ice\u2011cream parlor on Linking Road.\n\nAround 10:12\u202fam, while Mr.\u202fMehta was explaining the concept of electromagnetic induction, I felt the vibration of a message: \u201cYo, did you finish the lab report? Need it ASAP \ud83d\ude05\u201d. It was from Rohan, the guy two seats ahead who always had the latest memes saved on his phone. I glanced at the screen for a split second, then slipped it back into my bag. My heart was thudding like the bass at a DJ night in Lower Parel.\n\nBut the real drama started when I decided to pass a note to Aisha, the girl who always sat next to me and shared my love for \u201cBinge\u2011watching\u201d on Netflix (the latest season of \u201cStranger Things\u201d). I wrote, in my best cursive, \u201cCan you lend me your copy of \u2018Physics for JEE\u2019? I left it at home, and the deadline\u2019s tomorrow.\u201d I folded it into a tiny triangle, slid it under the desk, and hoped Mr.\u202fMehta\u2019s gaze would stay on the blackboard.\n\nHe turned around, his eyes narrowing. \u201cAisha, could you please hand me that paper?\u201d He reached for the note, but before he could, Rohan, who was trying to be sneaky with his phone, accidentally",

The screen lit up, showing a half\u2011read Instagram story of Priya\u2019s new \u201cMyntra\u201d haul.\n\nMr.\u202fMehta\u2019s voice cut through the murmurs: \u201cWho\u2019s using a phone in class? And what\u2019s this?\u201d He picked up the phone, stared at the screen, and then looked directly at me. \u201cAri, you\u2019ve been passing notes again? This is the third time this term.\u201d\n\nI felt my cheeks flush a deep crimson, and the whole class went silent except for the faint hum of the AC and the occasional squeak of a chair. Rohan tried to protest, \u201cSir, I was just\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cJust what? Checking Instagram? That\u2019s a violation of the school\u2019s ICT policy, and note\u2011passing is a disciplinary offense,\u201d Mr.\u202fMehta said, his tone a mix of irritation and disappointment. He turned to the front desk, called Mrs.\u202fDeshmukh, the vice\u2011principal, and within two minutes she was standing there, clipboard in hand, looking as stern as the statue of Lord Ganesha at the entrance of the school.\n\nMrs.\u202fDeshmukh announced, \u201cAll of you will stay after school for detention. Ari, you\u2019ll also have to write a reflective essay on why you think it\u2019s important to respect classroom rules. Rohan, you\u2019ll lose your phone for a week.\u201d\n\nThe detention was in the empty library, the one with the cracked windows overlooking the Bandra\u2011Worli Sea Link. We sat on the wooden tables, the only sound the distant honk of traffic and the occasional chime from the school bell. I wrote the essay on a thin notebook, trying to keep my handwriting neat despite the adrenaline still racing through me. I wrote about how I\u2019d been more focused on the \u201ccool factor\u201d of having the latest phone and the thrill of secret notes, rather than the actual physics lesson on Faraday\u2019s law.\n\nAfter school, while the rest of the class walked home, I lingered to collect my bag.",

That tiny gesture felt like a lifeline.\n\nWalking back home through the bustling streets of Bandra, the monsoon clouds were just starting to gather, and the smell of fresh pav bhaji from a nearby stall made me think about how quickly things could change. I realized that day that the \u201ccool\u201d moment of passing a note or checking a phone was fleeting, but the consequences\u2014detention, the essay, the loss of trust\u2014 lingered much longer.\n\nLooking back now, in 2025, as I sit in my tiny apartment in Bandra (the one with the balcony that overlooks the sea breeze), I still keep that OnePlus\u202f2 (now a relic) on my desk as a reminder. It\u2019s funny how a simple note and a phone can become a full\u2011blown scandal in 9th grade, but also a lesson that\u2019s shaped how I handle professionalism at my current job in a marketing tech startup\u2014no more sneaking phones in meetings, only well\u2011timed Slack messages.

He was the captain of the St.\u202fXavier\u2019s College basketball team, the one who always wore those neon\u2011green Nike Dri\u2011Fit tees and a pair of high\u2011top Air Jordan 1s that squeaked on the wooden court at the K.J. Somaiya Sports Complex. I was in my third year of the BBA program at NMIMS, doing a summer internship at a startup in Andheri, and I\u2019d joined the college\u2019s \u201cFit\u202f&\u202fFun\u201d club just to get a break from endless spreadsheets.\n\nThe first time I saw him, he was doing a perfect lay\u2011up, the ball swishing through the net while his teammates cheered. I was standing near the bleachers, sipping a cold Coca\u2011Cola from the can I\u2019d bought at the nearby Candies stall, and my heart did that weird \u201cthump\u2011thump\u201d thing you get when you\u2019re watching a Bollywood climax. I thought, \u201cYaar, this guy is so chill, but also\u2026 so intense.\u201d He had that deep, slightly wavy black hair that fell just above his eyebrows, and his smile was the kind you see in those old 90s Bollywood posters\u2014wide, confident, a little mischievous.\n\nA week later, I ran into him at the Gymkhana Club\u2019s rooftop caf\u00e9, where I usually grab a masala chai after my evening jogs. He was sitting with his teammates, ordering a cold brew from Starbucks, and I was there with my friend Riya, scrolling through Instagram on her iPhone. I must\u2019ve looked like a nervous mess, because I accidentally knocked over my water bottle, and the spill dribbled onto his notebook. He looked up, his eyes meeting mine, and for a split second I thought he\u2019d be annoyed. Instead, he laughed, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019m used to the court getting wet.\u201d He handed me a napkin, and we exchanged a quick \u201cHey, I\u2019m Ari\u201d and \u201cArjun, nice to meet you.\u201d It felt like a scene straight out of a teen drama, but I was too busy trying not to trip over my own words.\n\nFrom then on, I started showing up at every practice session, pretending I was just there to \u201csupport the team\u201d because I\u2019d signed",

I\u2019d sit on the bleachers with a notebook, pretending to take notes on \u201cteam dynamics,\u201d while secretly watching Arjun call out plays, his voice deep and commanding. He\u2019d often glance my way, give a quick nod, and I\u2019d feel my cheeks heat up. I even bought a pair of his favorite basketball shoes\u2014Nike LeBron 19s\u2014in a size 7, just to have an excuse to talk about them. \u201cThose are sick, right?\u201d I\u2019d say, and he\u2019d grin, \u201cYeah, they\u2019re my lucky shoes.\u201d I laughed, but inside I was already picturing us playing a one\u2011on\u2011one game at the Juhu beach court at sunset.\n\nThe real turning point came during the inter\u2011college tournament in March 2019. We were playing against the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay (IITB) team at the Shivaji Park courts. The whole campus was buzzing; the stands were filled with students holding up banners that read \u201cGo\u202fXavier!\u201d and \u201cChampions!\u201d I was sitting beside Arjun\u2019s best friend, Sameer, who kept nudging me, \u201cYou\u2019re his biggest fan, Ari. He\u2019s looking at you.\u201d I laughed it off, but my heart was racing.\n\nThe final seconds of the game were chaotic. Arjun stole the ball, made a swift crossover, and launched a three\u2011pointer that swished in as the buzzer sounded. The crowd erupted, and the team lifted him on their shoulders. In that moment, I felt a surge of pride\u2014like I was part of something bigger. He turned to the crowd, shouted \u201cBandra boys, we did it!\u201d and his eyes landed on me for a split second. I swear he smiled, and for a heartbeat I thought maybe there was a chance.\n\nA few days later, after the tournament, we all went out to celebrate at The Little Door in Bandra West. The place was dimly lit, the music was a mix of indie tracks and old Bollywood numbers. I was sitting at the bar, sipping a gin\u2011and\u2011tonic from the Bombay Sapphire bottle, when Arjun",

I was sitting at the bar, sipping a gin\u2011and\u2011tonic from the Bombay Sapphire bottle, when Arjun came over. He was a little drunk, his speech slurred, \u201cAri, you\u2019ve been a great supporter. I\u2026 I wanted to thank you.\u201d He placed his hand on my knee, and my mind went into overdrive. I could feel the heat from the bar\u2019s neon sign reflecting on his palm.\n\nBut then, just as quickly as the moment built, Sameer pulled Arjun away to join a group of senior players, shouting, \u201cCome on, bro! The night\u2019s still young!\u201d Arjun gave me a quick, apologetic smile, \u201cWe\u2019ll talk later, okay?\u201d and walked off.\n\nThe next morning, I woke up to a text from Arjun: \u201cHey, sorry about last night. Got caught up with the team. Let\u2019s catch up later this week?\u201d I replied with a simple \u201cSure, when?\u201d and then waited. The next day, I saw him at the campus canteen, laughing with his teammates over a plate of butter chicken from the nearby Sagar Ratna. He didn\u2019t even look my way. I felt a knot tighten in my chest.\n\nBy June 2019, the senior year was winding down, and Arjun was already preparing for his final exams and a potential internship at a sports marketing firm in Dubai. He started dating a girl from his hometown, Priya, who he\u2019d known since school. I saw them together at the Marine Drive promenade, holding hands, laughing at the sea breeze. I felt a pang of jealousy, but also a strange relief. It was like the final buzzer of a game I\u2019d been watching from the sidelines.\n\nI realized then that my crush had turned into a quiet admiration. I kept my distance, focusing on my own projects\u2014launching a digital campaign for a local boutique brand, \u201cBandra Threads,\u201d and eventually landing a full\u2011time role at a fintech startup in Powai. I still think about that first time Arjun\u2019s eyes met mine, the way his smile lit up the gym\u2019s fluorescent lights, and the bittersweet feeling of watching him move on.\n\nNow, in 2025, whenever I walk past the K.J.

I was sitting at my desk in the 12th floor of the KPMG office in Bandra Kurla Complex (BKC), scrolling through a LinkedIn post about the new Instagram Reels algorithm, when Priya from the SEO team slid a paper napkin across the table.\n\n\u201cYaar, you\u2019ve got that veg biryani in your tiffin? I\u2019ll swap you for my samosa box, please.\u201d She had that half\u2011smile that meant she\u2019d already bribed the canteen vendor, Hira\u2019s Snack Shack, for a fresh batch of the triangular gold\u2011brown wonders.\n\nI was still half\u2011asleep from the 6\u202fam jog I did at Carter Road, and the thought of my mom\u2019s butter\u2011melted chicken pulao\u2014still warm, the rice still a little fluffy\u2014was making my stomach grumble louder than the BKC traffic outside. But the idea of a hot, crisp samosa, the kind that Hira makes with a secret blend of cumin\u2011powdered potatoes and a dash of mango chutney, was too tempting. Plus, the office politics of lunch swaps were basically a currency among us millennials: a way to show you\u2019re in the loop, that you\u2019ve got connections, that you\u2019re not just a lone wolf eating your own mom\u2019s leftovers.\n\nSo I signed the \u201ccontract\u201d with a quick scribble: \u201cBiryani for 5 samosas + one extra chai (no sugar) from the canteen.\u201d Priya\u2019s eyes lit up, and she whispered, \u201cDeal, Ari. You\u2019re officially part of the \u2018Samosa Club\u2019 now.\u201d\n\nThe actual swap happened at 1:15\u202fpm, right by the glass doors that open onto the BKC garden. I opened my tiffin\u2014an insulated stainless\u2011steel box from Tupperware, the one with the blue lid and the little \u201ckeep it hot\u201d sticker\u2014 and lifted the lid. The aroma of saffron and ghee hit me instantly. I could see the tiny flecks of coriander on top, the faint steam still rising. I took a quick picture for my Instagram Story, captioning it \u201cHome\u2011cooked love vs. canteen cravings \ud83c\udf7d\ufe0f #LunchboxPolitics\u201d.\n\nPriya handed me her paper-wrapped samosa box, a",

I took a quick picture for my Instagram Story, captioning it \u201cHome\u2011cooked love vs. canteen cravings \ud83c\udf7d\ufe0f #LunchboxPolitics\u201d.\n\nPriya handed me her paper-wrapped samosa box, a simple brown kraft paper tied with a red string. Inside, five perfectly fried samosas lay side by side, each with a golden crust that glistened under the office lights. I could hear the faint sizzle as she unwrapped one, and the smell of fried potatoes and peas mixed with the faint tang of tamarind chutney wafted across the table. I took a bite, and the crunch was so loud it made the nearby cubicle occupants glance over. The filling was creamy, just the right amount of spiced, and the chutney added that sweet\u2011sour punch that made my taste buds do a little dance.\n\nWhile I was chewing, the \u201clunchbox politics\u201d unfolded in real time. Rohan from the product team, who always carries a vegan quinoa salad from his mom\u2019s kitchen, tried to negotiate a swap for a veggie roll from the canteen\u2019s \u201cMithai & More\u201d stall. Meanwhile, Ayesha from finance, who\u2019s notorious for bringing the \u201cspecial\u201d paneer tikka in a glass jar, offered me a piece of her homemade mango lassi in exchange for my extra samosa. The whole scene felt like a mini\u2011stock market, each dish a share, each swap a trade.\n\nBy 1:45\u202fpm, I was back at my desk, stomach full, but also feeling a weird sense of camaraderie. The act of swapping food turned into a silent acknowledgment that we\u2019re all juggling the same pressures: early morning meetings, deadline crunches, and the constant battle of \u201cwhat\u2019s for lunch?\u201d It was also a reminder that, despite the tech\u2011heavy world we live in\u2014Zoom calls, Slack pings, and AI\u2011generated reports\u2014there\u2019s still a very human, tactile economy happening over a lunchbox.\n\nLater that evening, I called Mom and told her about the swap. She laughed, \u201cBeta, you\u2019re turning your biryani into a stock! Next time, I\u2019ll make extra samosas for you, okay?\u201d She promised to add a small batch of her own \u201cBandra\u2011style\u201d samosas to the next week\u2019s tiffin, with a",

The night before the first English paper (May\u202f31,\u202f2016), he called me into the study room and said, \u201cAri, you need at least 90\u202f% in English if you want a good college later. Remember what I told you about the \u2018future\u2019\u2014this is the first step.\u201d He even pulled out his old college\u2011admission brochure from 1998 and placed it on the table as a \u201cmotivation board.\u201d My mom, Meera, a school teacher at St.\u202fXavier\u2019s, was equally intense but in a softer way: she\u2019d bring me a plate of Parle\u2011G biscuits and a glass of masala chai every night, whispering, \u201cDon\u2019t stress, beta, just focus. You\u2019ve done the work, now trust yourself.\u201d \n\nI felt like I was juggling three things at once: the syllabus, the expectations, and the constant background noise of my younger brother, Rohan, who was in 7th\u202fstandard and kept shouting, \u201cAri, do your maths for me, I need to finish my homework!\u201d He\u2019d also prank\u2011call my phone with the ringtone from the latest \u201cBhoot\u201d movie, just to see if I\u2019d lose my cool.\n\n**The \u201cextra\u201d classes**\n\nBecause the school\u2019s internal tests were barely enough, we were enrolled at Aakash Institute in Bandra Reclamation for extra tuition.

My dad had stayed up late the night before finalising a client presentation, and his laptop was still open on the kitchen counter, flashing \u201cPending\u2026\u201d. He walked in, gave me a quick hug, and said, \u201cAll the numbers you solve now will help you understand the numbers in life later.\u201d I laughed, but the joke fell flat.

My mom\u2019s phone buzzed with a notification: \u201cYour 10th\u202fgrade results are out.\u201d I opened the app, saw 88\u202f% in English, 85\u202f% in Maths, 87\u202f% in Science, and 90\u202f% in Social Studies. The overall aggregate was 87.5\u202f%\u2014good, but not the 90\u202f% my dad had been chanting about.\n\nDad\u2019s reaction was a mix of disappointment and a forced smile: \u201cAri, you did well, but there\u2019s room to improve.

At my current job at RazorPay, I\u2019m judged more on impact than on a percentage.\n2. **Self\u2011care is non\u2011negotiable** \u2013 The few evenings I escaped to Candies on Hill Road for a quick chocolate milkshake were the only moments I truly breathed. I still treat those 10\u2011minute breaks as essential.\n3. **Family dynamics evolve** \u2013 My parents have softened their \u201cboard\u2011exam\u201d rhetoric. Now they ask, \u201cWhat are you passionate about?\u201d instead of \u201cWhat\u2019s your next score?\u201d\n\nEven though the stress was intense, the memory of that June night, the chai, the Parle\u2011G, and the sea\u2011link lights, still feels like a turning point\u2014one that turned a teenage pressure cooker into a lifelong lesson on balancing expectations with self\u2011belief.",

My parents were sitting on the sofa in our Bandra flat, the fan humming, and my dad kept saying, \u201cXavier\u2019s is the \u2018real\u2019 college, yaar, you\u2019ll get the pedigree, the network.\u201d Meanwhile my best friend, Riya, was texting me nonstop from her hostel at Jai\u202fHind, \u201cBro, the vibe there is insane, you\u2019ll love the freedom. No strict dress code, no \u2018no\u2011mobile\u2011phone\u2019 rule in labs. Just pure fun.\u201d\n\nThe first campus visit was on 12\u202fApril\u202f2018. I took the local train from Bandra to Dadar, hopped onto the Western line, and got off at the Xavier\u2019s gate. The Gothic\u2011style fa\u00e7ade, the huge stone arches, the massive clock tower \u2013 it felt like stepping into a movie set. The students I met were mostly in crisp white shirts and navy blazers, carrying leather satchels, and the whole place smelled faintly of old books and coffee from the campus canteen (the one that serves those killer masala chai and almond croissants). I sat in the courtyard, watching a group from the Marketing Club rehearse a pitch for a mock client \u2013 they were all speaking in perfect English, using terms like \u201cbrand equity\u201d and \u201cconsumer journey\u201d with a confidence that made me feel both inspired and a little out of place. The senior who introduced himself as \u201cSir\u202fMohan, Marketing Head\u201d told me, \u201cHere we push each other to be the best, but we also respect the hierarchy. You\u2019ll have to earn your seat at the table.\u201d\n\nTwo weeks later, I went to Jai\u202fHind College in Churchgate. The campus is a mix of old colonial buildings and modern glass structures, with a huge open-air amphitheatre that\u2019s always buzzing. The first thing that hit me was the graffiti on the walls \u2013 bright, unapologetic, with tags like \u201cJH\u202fVibes\u201d and \u201cLive\u202fFree\u201d. The students were in casual tees, ripped jeans, and sneakers. I remember sitting under the shade of a mango tree in the college quad, listening",

I remember sitting under the shade of a mango tree in the college quad, listening to a friend from the Drama Society recite a monologue from \u201cHamlet\u201d in Hindi\u2011English mix, while a group of seniors were playing a heated game of cricket on the field next to us. The atmosphere was loud, chaotic, but somehow cohesive. The canteen served everything from vada pav to sushi rolls, and the \u201cJH Juice Bar\u201d was famous for its mango lassi with a splash of ginger.\n\nThe culture shock was real. At Xavier\u2019s, there was an unspoken rule: be punctual, be polished, keep your phone on silent during lectures. I remember the first day of the \u201cStrategic Marketing\u201d class \u2013 the professor, Dr\u202fRaghav Menon, walked in with a leather briefcase, set his laptop on the podium, and said, \u201cNo phones, no laptops, just pen and paper.\u201d I felt my heart race because I was used to having my iPhone at arm\u2019s length for quick fact\u2011checking. At Jai\u202fHind, the professor of \u201cDigital Media Trends\u201d actually encouraged us to pull up real\u2011time data on our phones while discussing TikTok algorithms. He\u2019d say, \u201cIf you see something interesting on Instagram, share it on the board, we\u2019ll dissect it.\u201d That freedom felt like a breath of fresh air after the strictness of Xavier\u2019s.\n\nChoosing between the two wasn\u2019t just about academics; it was about the lifestyle I wanted. I thought about my weekend routine: Saturday mornings at Candies, sipping a caramel macchiato while scrolling through LinkedIn for internships. At Xavier\u2019s, the \u201cXavier\u2019s Alumni Meet\u201d was a monthly thing \u2013 a formal dinner at the Taj\u202fMahal\u202fPalace, where senior executives from Hindustan Unilever and Google would mingle with students. The idea of rubbing shoulders with a VP of Marketing at 21 was thrilling, but also intimidating. At Jai\u202fHind, the \u201cOpen Mic Night\u201d at the college\u2019s basement lounge (the one with the neon sign \u201cJH\u202fStage\u201d) was a weekly ritual.

I\u2019d watch indie bands, rap battles, and even a stand\u2011up comedy session by a sophomore who later got a gig at The Habitat. The sense of community was more organic, less curated.\n\nIn the end, I went with Jai\u202fHind. The decision was sealed on 28\u202fMay\u202f2018, after a late\u2011night conversation with my older sister, who works at a startup in Andheri. She said, \u201cAri, you\u2019re a hustler. You\u2019ll thrive where you can experiment, fail fast, and learn on the go. Jai\u202fHind gives you that playground.\u201d The first semester, I joined the \u201cDigital Marketing Club\u201d and the \u201cStreet Photography Society\u201d. My first project was a collaborative Instagram campaign for a local boutique in Bandra West \u2013 we shot the entire shoot at the iconic Bandra\u2011Worli Sea Link at sunset, using the sea\u2011link\u2019s neon lights as a backdrop. The post got 12k likes within 24\u202fhours, and the boutique owner called me the next day, \u201cAri, you\u2019ve got a magic touch, yaar!\u201d\n\nLooking back, the culture shock was less about the buildings and more about the mindset. Xavier\u2019s taught me discipline, structure, and the power of a polished network. Jai\u202fHind gave me the freedom to experiment, to blend Hindi\u2011English, to turn a mango tree into a brainstorming hub, and to own my own narrative. The freedom I got there still echoes in my day\u2011to\u2011day work at a fintech startup in Powai \u2013 I still carry that mango\u2011lassi\u2011spilled notebook from my Jai\u202fHind days, and whenever I\u2019m in a boardroom, I remember the chaos of that college quad and let a little of that \u201cJH vibe\u201d seep into my presentations.

Like, a tiny one, just a little sparkle. It\u2019ll be our secret rebellion, yaar.\u201d She\u2019d been scrolling through Instagram, obsessing over that tiny gold hoop that Priyanka Chopra wore at the IIFA awards. I was still a bit scared of the pain, but also kinda thrilled\u2014like finally doing something that wasn\u2019t just \u201cstudying for the next semester\u201d.\n\nWe booked an appointment at **The Needle Studio**, a tiny but super clean piercing boutique on Hill Road. The interior was all pastel pink and white, with a wall of framed vintage Bollywood posters. The piercer, a guy named Arjun who\u2019d done a masterclass at the Mumbai Tattoo & Piercing Expo 2018, showed me a 14\u2011gauge stainless steel stud with a tiny Swarovski crystal. \u201cIt\u2019ll heal in 6\u20118 weeks, no problem,\u201d he said, smiling reassuringly.\n\nThe moment the clamp clicked, I felt a sharp pinch\u2014like a quick electric shock\u2014followed by a weird, tingling buzz. I tried not to gasp, but my eyes watered a bit. Riya held my hand, whispering, \u201cMatlab, it\u2019s over, we\u2019re officially rebels now.\u201d The crystal settled into my left nostril, catching the light whenever I turned my head. I walked out of The Needle Studio feeling oddly proud and a little self\u2011conscious; the whole of Bandra seemed to notice. My mother, who lives in Khar, called later that evening. \u201cAri, why did you do that? You\u2019re still 18, you know how conservative Mom can be.\u201d I tried to sound casual, \u201cJust a little something, Mom.

I\u2019d always loved the classic black hair, but after binge\u2011watching *Euphoria* and seeing the neon pink streaks on the characters, I wanted a splash of colour\u2014something that screamed \u201cI\u2019m not just a marketing intern, I\u2019m also an artist\u201d.\n\nI booked a slot at **BBlunt**, the boutique salon on Pali Hill, on a rainy Thursday in December\u202f2019. The stylist, Naina, was known for her bold colour work; she\u2019d done the \u201cSunset Ombre\u201d for a Bollywood influencer last month. I asked for a single pastel lilac streak, starting from the front left temple and fading into the back. She mixed the dye with a brand\u2011new **Manic Panic** pastel violet, a colour I\u2019d seen at the **Lime Tree** pop\u2011up shop in Colaba.\n\nThe process was surprisingly gentle. Naina wrapped my hair in a soft plastic cap, applied the dye, and let it sit for 45\u202fminutes while we chatted about the upcoming Diwali campaign at my company, **Swiggy\u2019s** new \u201cTaste of Home\u201d series. The salon\u2019s playlist was a mix of Badshah, Dua Lipa, and old Hindi classics\u2014perfect background for a rebellious makeover.\n\nWhen the cap came off, the lilac streak was vivid, almost glowing against my dark hair. I could see it in the mirror, and for the first time in years, I felt like I could wear something that wasn\u2019t just \u201cacceptable\u201d for a SoBo girl. I walked out of BBlunt with a fresh coffee from **Starbucks** on the ground floor, and a feeling of \u201cI own this\u201d.\n\nMy parents\u2019 reaction was a mix of shock and eventual acceptance. Mom called the next day, \u201cAri, why did you turn your hair pink? It\u2019s not a colour for a professional woman.\u201d I replied, \u201cIt\u2019s just a streak, Mom.

They weren\u2019t just fashion statements; they were tiny rebellions that taught me how to speak up, to experiment, and to say \u201cyes\u201d to the parts of me that don\u2019t fit the usual script.

The project demanded 70\u2011hour weeks, and I\u2019d be in the office at *Bandra Kurla Complex* until 10\u202fpm, often missing our scheduled calls. Arjun, meanwhile, was prepping for his final semester at *St. Xavier\u2019s College*, juggling a part\u2011time gig as a freelance graphic designer for *Zomato*. He started feeling neglected, and his messages turned short: \u201cBusy?\u201d \u201cCan we talk later?\u201d The silence grew, and the once\u2011daily \u201cGood morning, love\u201d texts became sporadic.\n\nThe tipping point was the night of 12\u202fDecember\u202f2023. I had just returned from a client dinner at *The Taj Mahal Palace* (the view of the Arabian Sea was breathtaking, but my mind was elsewhere). I found Arjun sitting on the balcony of his parents\u2019 flat in *Juhu*, scrolling through his phone. He didn\u2019t say a word, just handed me a *Netflix* gift card and said, \u201cMaybe we need a break, yaar. I\u2019m feeling like we\u2019re just...",

We talked for an hour, both trying to rationalize the growing distance. He wanted to focus on his final year projects and a potential full\u2011time role at *Adobe*, while I was already eyeing a move to *Meta* in Singapore for a senior marketing analyst position.\n\nWe decided to end things amicably on 15\u202fDecember\u202f2023. It wasn\u2019t a dramatic breakup; we just agreed to \u201cpause\u201d the romance and support each other\u2019s careers. We sent each other a final message: \u201cThank you for the memories, Arjun. Let\u2019s stay friends.\u201d We haven\u2019t spoken much since, except for an occasional \u201cCongrats on the promotion!\u201d on LinkedIn.\n\nLooking back now, in March\u202f2025, as I sip my *Koin* latte at *The Nutcracker* in Bandra (the place where I now work on content strategy for *Byju\u2019s*), I realize that the two\u2011year whirlwind taught me a lot about boundaries, ambition, and the balance between love and self\u2011growth. The intense romance was beautiful, but it also taught me that sometimes the best thing you can do for someone you love is to let them go and chase your own path.",

My dad, who\u2019s a civil engineer at Larsen &\u202fToubro, had already started sketching out a \u201cperfect\u201d engineering path for me since I was in 9th\u202fstandard\u2014MTech at IIT Bombay, a stable job at Tata\u202fConsultancy Services, the usual \u201csecure\u201d script. Mom, a school teacher at St.\u202fXavier\u2019s College, kept reminding me that \u201caapko jo dil se pasand hai, wahi karna chahiye, yaar.\u201d \n\nThe brochure was for the Bachelor of Mass Media (BMM) program at NMIMS, Mumbai. It listed modules like \u201cMedia Ethics,\u201d \u201cDigital Storytelling,\u201d and \u201cAudience Psychology.\u201d The word \u201cPsychology\u201d was bolded in the course outline, and that caught my eye. I had been obsessed with the human mind ever since I read \u201cThinking, Fast and Slow\u201d (the Hindi translation, \u201cSoch, Tez aur Dhimi\u201d) in my 12th\u202fstandard library. I\u2019d also spent countless evenings at Candies, sipping masala chai while my friends from engineering talked about circuits and code; I\u2019d listen, half\u2011interested, half\u2011amused, and half\u2011confused about why they were so thrilled about a 0.001\u202f\u00b5F capacitor.\n\nThe turning point was the open house at NMIMS on 15\u202fAugust\u202f2018. I walked into the auditorium of the S.\u202fV.\u202fB.\u202fCollege of Arts, where the dean, Dr.\u202fAnita Mehta, gave a fiery talk about \u201cMedia as a Mirror of Society.\u201d She showed a clip from the 2020 Netflix docu\u2011series \u201cThe Social Dilemma\u201d and then asked, \u201cWhat does it tell us about collective anxiety?\u201d I felt a jolt\u2014this was exactly where my love for psychology met my fascination for media. After the talk, I chatted with a senior named Riya, who was doing her final year in BMM. She told me how she\u2019d interned at Times\u202fInternet, working on a project that mapped user sentiment during the 2021 Mumbai floods using sentiment analysis. \u201cIt\u2019s like being a therapist for a city,\u201d she laughed, and I could",

He\u2019d call me every night, \u201cAri, you\u2019re missing out on the biggest thing\u2014AI and robotics!\u201d I\u2019d reply, \u201cArjun, I\u2019m fine with my own kind of tech. I want to understand why people binge\u2011watch drama series during monsoon, not how to code a drone.\u201d The more I tried to imagine a life glued to a lab bench, the more claustrophobic it felt. I could already picture the fluorescent lights, the endless spreadsheets, the occasional coffee breaks at Starbucks on Linking Road\u2014nothing that made my heart race.\n\nWhen I finally filled out the NMIMS application on 3\u202fSeptember\u202f2018, I wrote in the personal statement: \u201cI want to explore how media narratives shape collective behavior, especially in a city as diverse as Mumbai, where every street corner tells a different story.\u201d I mentioned my volunteer stint at the NGO \u201cSaksham,\u201d where I helped run workshops on mental health awareness for school kids in Dharavi. That experience taught me that storytelling can be therapeutic, and that\u2019s why I chose BMM with a focus on Psychology over the more \u201csecure\u201d engineering route.\n\nThe day I got the admission letter\u201423\u202fSeptember\u202f2018\u2014my dad stared at it for a minute, then smiled and said, \u201cAri, you\u2019ve always been a little different.

The receptionist, a petite girl named Riya who always smelled faintly of vanilla chai, handed me a sleek white badge that read \u201cIntern \u2013 Creative Ops\u201d. My desk was a cramped corner of the open\u2011plan floor, a second\u2011hand MacBook Pro, a stack of Post\u2011it notes, and a half\u2011empty bottle of \u201cCaf\u00e9 Coffee Day\u201d cold brew that I\u2019d rescued from a morning run to Candies on Linking Road.\n\nThe first week was a blur of onboarding decks, brand guidelines for \u201cHavells\u201d and \u201cSwiggy\u201d, and endless Slack pings from the senior strategist, Aditi, who called herself \u201cThe Brain\u201d. She\u2019d drop memes in the #creative\u2011channel (\u201cYaar, this brief is more confusing than the Mumbai monsoon schedule\u201d) and then assign me to \u201crun the social calendar for the new Tanishq bridal collection\u201d. I thought I was in for a fun ride \u2013 until the horror began.\n\n**The Night the Campaign Went South**\n\nIt was August\u202f12, 2022, a scorching Tuesday, and we were prepping a launch for \u201cTanishq \u2013 Eternal Vows\u201d. The client (a senior exec from Tanishq\u2019s Mumbai office) wanted a \u201cviral TikTok challenge\u201d that would showcase \u201cmodern Indian brides dancing to a classic Bollywood remix\u201d. The brief was vague, the deadline was 5\u202fpm, and the creative lead, Rohit, was out on a \u201cclient dinner\u201d at \u201cBadeMiya\u201d (we all know the real reason: he was trying to impress a potential investor with kebabs).\n\nAditi threw the whole thing at me: \u201cAri, you\u2019re on the copy, the storyboard, and the TikTok hashtag. Make it pop, okay? No more than 3 drafts, and send the final to the client by EOD.\u201d I felt my heart race, but I said \u201cSure, no problem\u201d because saying \u201cI\u2019m not comfortable\u201d felt like a career\u2011killing red flag in a place that already called me \u201cthe intern who never sleeps\u201d.\n\nI spent the next three hours drafting copy, designing mock\u2011ups in Canva,",

I was still at my desk, eyes glued to the screen, when a Slack notification pinged: \u201cClient call in 10\u202fmin \u2013 urgent.\u201d I hadn\u2019t even seen the email with the client\u2019s new \u201clast\u2011minute\u201d request: they wanted the hashtag to be #EternalVows2022, but also to include the phrase \u201c#SwiggySamosa\u201d because they were cross\u2011promoting with Swiggy\u2019s \u201cSamosa Saturday\u201d campaign.\n\nI stared at the screen, my brain doing a full Mumbai traffic jam: \u201cMatlab, they want a wedding hashtag with a snack promo?!\u201d I tried to explain politely in the call that the two brands had very different tones, but the client\u2019s senior VP, a stern lady named Priyanka, cut me off: \u201cWe need it now. You have 30\u202fminutes to re\u2011work the entire copy and get it approved. No excuses.\u201d\n\nI rushed back to my desk, opened a fresh Google Doc, typed something like \u201c#EternalVows2022 \u2013 Celebrate love with a side of Swiggy\u2019s Samosa Saturday. #SwiggySamosa\u201d, and sent it to Aditi for a quick review. She replied within seconds: \u201cAri, this is *not* the vibe. It looks like a grocery ad, not a bridal campaign. Fix it. NOW.\u201d My hands were shaking; I could hear the distant honk of traffic from the BKC flyover, the smell of rain on concrete creeping through the office ventilation.\n\nI spent the next 45\u202fminutes rewriting, trying to weave the two brand voices together without sounding like a confused auntie. I finally landed on: \u201c#EternalVows2022 \u2013 Love is sweet, just like Swiggy\u2019s Samosa Saturday.

No more coffee breaks.\u201d\n\n**The Aftermath**\n\nI stayed until 4\u202fam, surviving on stale croissants from \u201cThe Nutcracker\u201d on Carter Road and endless gulps of the remaining cold brew. I rewrote the copy, stripped out the Swiggy reference, and added a subtle nod: \u201c#EternalVows2022 \u2013 Love, like a perfect bite, is timeless.\u201d I sent it, and the client finally approved at 5:30\u202fam. The relief was palpable; I could hear the distant call to prayer from Haji\u202fAli as the sun began to rise over Marine Drive.\n\nThe horror didn\u2019t end there. On August\u202f30, the day my internship officially ended, I walked into the office to find a handwritten note on my desk: \u201cThanks for the hustle, Ari. We\u2019ll be in touch for future projects. \u2013 PixelPulse.\u201d There was no mention of a recommendation letter, no stipend, and no \u201cgood luck\u201d from the senior team. I asked Aditi for feedback over a quick coffee at \u201cStarbucks, Bandra West\u201d. She smiled, sipped her latte, and said, \u201cYou did great under pressure, but next time, make sure you push back a little. You\u2019re too nice, yaar.\u201d I left with a mix of pride and bitterness, clutching a single \u201cPixelPulse\u201d merch mug that smelled faintly of burnt coffee.\n\nLooking back now, in 2025, the internship feels like a horror movie set in the world of Instagram reels and brand briefs.

Malhar was in full swing, the quad lit up like a neon jungle, and the whole place smelled of fried vada pav from the stalls at the Food Court and the sweet, sticky aroma of jalebi from the \u201cJalebi Junction\u201d booth (sponsored by Parle\u2011G).  \n\n**The prep chaos**  \nTwo weeks before the event, the whole \u201cMALHAR\u201124\u201d committee (I was the Social Media Lead) had our weekly war\u2011room in the old Computer Lab 3, where the walls were plastered with sticky notes in every colour\u2014\u201cPoster deadline: 28\u202fJan\u201d, \u201cSponsor: HUL, need sign\u2011off\u201d, \u201cVenue: L\u2011Towers Stage\u201d. We\u2019d have three people on the phone at once: my teammate Priyanka negotiating with the campus radio (Radio Mirchi 98.3) for a live interview, another teammate Rohan juggling the logistics for the \u201cEco\u2011Warriors\u201d flash\u2011mob, and me frantically updating the Instagram story every time a new act was confirmed.  \n\nThe biggest nightmare was the **technical rehearsal** on 3\u202fMarch. The PA system (Mackie\u202f8000\u202fSeries) kept cutting out whenever the DJ (DJ\u202fMithun from Bandra) tried to transition from \u201cMere Rashke Qamar\u201d to \u201cLevitating\u201d. We discovered the culprit: a faulty XLR cable that had been tucked behind the stage curtains for weeks. I spent an hour crawling under the stage, pulling the cable out while Rohan shouted, \u201cYaar, don\u2019t drop the mic again!\u201d and the whole crew was on edge because the main sponsor, Tata\u202fMotors, was watching the live feed from their corporate office in BKC.  \n\n**Backstage drama**  \nOn the day of the performance, the backstage area was a maze of half\u2011packed boxes, a stray guitar case belonging to the rock band \u201cThe Neon Bhangra\u201d, and a frantic line of volunteers trying to hand out water bottles (still the same 500\u202fml Aquafina we\u2019d ordered in",

The lead vocalist of my band, Aisha, was stuck in the ladies\u2019 washroom because the lock jammed. I ran in, grabbed a spare key from the security guard (who was also a part\u2011time DJ at \u201cThe Little Door\u201d bar in Bandra) and unlocked it just in time for her to sprint onto the stage, hair still damp from the rain\u2011shower we\u2019d set up for the \u201cMonsoon Mood\u201d act.  \n\nWhen we finally hit the stage, the crowd of 3,500 (official count from the Student Affairs Office) was a sea of flashing phones, neon wristbands from \u201cPulse\u201d (our official merch partner), and a few bewildered seniors from the Department of Physics who had come just for the \u201cScience\u2011Pop\u201d act.

The engineer, a lanky guy named Karthik, had to re\u2011program the dB\u2011SPL levels on the dB\u2011Technics mixing console while the rain hammered against the stadium\u2019s temporary roof.  \n\nThe backstage area at Mood Indigo was a labyrinth of \u201cgreen\u2011room\u201d tents, each labelled with a different colour\u2014Blue for the \u201cHip\u2011Hop\u201d crews, Green for the \u201cClassical\u201d ensembles, and a glaring orange tent where the \u201cFood\u2011Court Committee\u201d was fighting over the last batch of \u201cMasala Dosa\u201d from the \u201cSagar\u2019s Dosa Corner\u201d. I remember standing near the orange tent, sipping a cold bottle of Kingfisher Ultra, and watching a group of final\u2011year engineering students scramble to set up a LED wall that displayed the festival\u2019s logo (a stylised peacock). The wall kept flickering because the power inverter (a cheap, imported brand) kept overheating.

The feeling was surreal: the chaotic backstage, the last\u2011minute tech fixes, the sweaty palms, all melting into a single, electric moment where the crowd sang along in perfect sync.  \n\n**Takeaway**  \nBoth festivals taught me that the magic you see on stage is always backed by a tornado of emails, broken cables, frantic volunteers, and a lot of chai\u2011breaks (the \u201cChai\u2011Sutra\u201d stall from",

On 12\u202fMarch\u202f2023, the app flashed \u201cTechnical fault \u2013 10\u202fmin delay\u201d and I could feel the collective sigh of the entire Bandra crowd. By the time I reached Bandra station, the platform was a sea of saris, school bags, and the occasional corporate blazer. The ladies\u2019 compartment door was already half\u2011open, and a wave of heat and humidity hit me like a wall of steam from the 7\u202fam monsoon.\n\nI squeezed into the carriage, elbow\u2011to\u2011elbow with a lady in a navy blue kurta who was holding a baby in a pink sling. The baby\u2019s cry blended with the screech of the brakes and the metallic clang of the doors. A few metres ahead, a young guy in a crisp white shirt tried to slip into the compartment, his hand hovering near the \u201cLadies Only\u201d sign. I could see the security guard\u2019s stern eyes, and he quickly retreated, muttering \u201cMatlab, I\u2019m just trying to get a seat.\u201d The whole scene felt like a choreography of tension and patience.\n\nThe train lurched out of Bandra, and the doors slammed shut with that iconic \u201cchik\u2011chik\u201d sound that still makes my heart race. The carriage was packed so tightly that I could feel the sweat of strangers on my back. The smell of stale chai from the vendor at the end of the compartment mixed with the faint aroma of incense from a small bottle of \u201cMaa Ka Ashirwad\u201d that a lady kept pulling out every now and then. I clutched my phone, checking the latest campaign brief for my job at OYO\u2019s digital marketing team, while trying not to spill my homemade almond milk latte on the lady\u2019s sari.\n\nAt Dadar, the train stopped for a brief 30\u2011second pause.

A teenage girl in a varsity jacket whispered, \u201cYaar, the train\u2019s going to be late again today, I have my final exam at 10\u202fam.\u201d I nodded, feeling that familiar pang of solidarity\u2014everyone is rushing, everyone is stressed, and the local is the only thing that actually gets us where we need to be on time.\n\n**The Love (the unexpected kindness)**  \nBut then there are the moments that make me actually love this chaotic beast. On 8\u202fJuly\u202f2024, I was standing near the middle of the carriage, juggling my tote bag, a half\u2011eaten vada pav from \u201cMaharaja Vada Pav\u201d (the one near Dadar station that sells the best chutney), and a stack of printed reports for a client pitch. A middle\u2011aged lady in a bright orange salwar\u2011kameez noticed my struggle and slipped a small packet of tissues into my hand, saying, \u201cBeta, don\u2019t worry, you\u2019ll manage.\u201d She smiled, and for a split second the whole compartment seemed a little warmer.\n\nLater that same ride, a group of three women\u2014two in their early thirties, one in a crisp white blouse, the other in a floral kurti, and a younger woman in a college hoodie\u2014started a quick discussion about the upcoming \u201cWomen\u2019s Safety Awareness\u201d drive organized by the Mumbai Railway Vikas Corporation (MRVC). They handed out pamphlets and even a QR code for a free self\u2011defense workshop on 15\u202fNov\u202f2024. I scanned it, feeling a surge of empowerment that the local train, often painted as a place of vulnerability, could also be a platform for community building.\n\nOne of the most unforgettable incidents happened on 22\u202fDecember\u202f2022, right before the festive rush. A young mother with a toddler in a stroller was trying to board the train at Andheri. The doors were already closing, and the crowd was pushing.

That moment reminded me that the ladies\u2019 compartment isn\u2019t just a rule; it\u2019s a promise of solidarity.\n\n**The Balance**  \nSo my relationship with the Mumbai Local, especially the ladies\u2019 compartment, is a constant oscillation between frustration and gratitude. The train is my most reliable time\u2011keeper\u2014if I miss the 7:05\u202fam, I\u2019m late for the 9\u202fam stand\u2011up meeting at our SoBo office in Bandra Kurla Complex (BKC). Yet it\u2019s also a space where I\u2019ve learned to navigate crowds, assert my space, and receive unexpected kindness from strangers who share the same cramped carriage.\n\nEvery time I step out at Bandra station, I feel a mix of exhaustion and triumph. I walk past the familiar \u201cCaf\u00e9 Coffee Day\u201d sign, grab a quick bite at \u201cThe Nutcracker\u201d (the little bakery on Hill Road), and think, \u201cYaar, I survived another ride. Tomorrow, I\u2019ll do it again, but maybe with a little more chai and a lot more patience.\u201d\n\nIn short, the ladies\u2019 compartment is my daily drama\u2014full of noisy trains, crowded aisles, and occasional heroes in orange kurtas. It\u2019s a love\u2011hate relationship that I wouldn\u2019t trade for any other mode of transport in this city. And as long as the \u201cLadies Only\u201d sign hangs proudly on the carriage, I\u2019ll keep riding, hoping for more of those tiny moments that make the chaos feel human.",

The flat is on the fourth floor of a low\u2011rise (5\u2011storey) building that still has the old\u2011school wooden doors and a tiny balcony that looks out onto the tree\u2011lined lane behind the \u201cBandra Reclamation\u201d market. The rent is \u20b980,000 per month (including water and a modest security deposit of \u20b92\u202flakh), which feels like a lot for a 2BHK, but the location and the vibe make it worth every rupee.\n\nThe layout is exactly what a SoBo\u2011grown\u2011up would love: a spacious living\u2011room with a mid\u2011century modern sofa from\u202fWestside, a wall\u2011mounted Sony Bravia 55\u2011inch TV, and a small coffee table that doubles as a laptop stand. The kitchen is a compact but functional L\u2011shaped space with a 2\u2011burner gas stove, a stainless\u2011steel LG fridge, and a set of Tupperware containers that I bought during a \u201cstock\u2011up\u201d sale at\u202fBig Bazaar in December\u202f2022. The bedroom is my sanctuary\u2014an IKEA MALM bed frame, a set of pastel\u2011blue linen from\u202fZara Home, and a tiny reading nook by the window where the sea breeze drifts in during monsoon evenings.\n\nI share the flat with two flatmates: Riya, a 25\u2011year\u2011old product designer at\u202fZomato, and Kunal, a 26\u2011year\u2011old data analyst who works remotely for a fintech startup in Bengaluru. We split the rent 1:1:1, so each of us pays \u20b926,666 plus a share of the electricity bill (which usually hovers around \u20b93,500 per month). We have a \u201cchore chart\u201d on a whiteboard in the kitchen that we update every Sunday; Riya does the dishes on weekdays, Kunal handles the trash and recycling, and I\u2019m in charge of grocery runs and occasional deep\u2011cleaning of the bathroom.

The place is always buzzing with a mix of young professionals and older couples, and the aroma of freshly brewed coffee instantly lifts my mood. We usually sit at the corner table by the window, where I can see the traffic on Hill Road and the occasional rickshaw darting past.\n\nPost\u2011brunch, we either hit the gym at\u202fGold\u2019s Gym\u202fBandra (Kunal\u2019s go\u2011to for his HIIT sessions) or take a leisurely walk along the Carter Road promenade. The sea\u2011view at sunset is my favorite\u2014there\u2019s this one spot near the \u201cBandra Fort\u201d where the sky turns a deep orange and the wind carries the salty scent of the Arabian Sea. I often stand there with my phone, scrolling through Instagram stories, feeling a mix of gratitude and a tiny pang of nostalgia because my parents still live in their spacious 3BHK in Juhu, just a 15\u2011minute drive away. They\u2019re the ones who helped me with the initial deposit, and every now and then they drop by with a homemade \u201cvada pav\u201d box, reminding me of my childhood street\u2011food cravings.\n\nLiving with flatmates has also sharpened my \u201cpeople\u2011skills\u201d game.

Yesterday I built a Jupyter notebook that flagged a 3.2\u202f% drop\u2011off on the \u201cAdd\u2011ons\u201d screen for users in Bandra West.  \n\n- **A/B testing & attribution:** I design experiments in Optimizely, set up control and variant groups, and monitor the lift using Google Analytics 4. In March\u202f2024 we ran a \u201cMonsoon Deals\u201d test on the \u201cFree\u2011Delivery\u201d banner \u2013 the variant drove a 7.5\u202f% increase in GMV for the Mumbai metro region.  \n\n- **Cross\u2011functional coordination:** I\u2019m the bridge between the product squad, the creative team at \u201cThe Glitch\u201d (our in\u2011house agency), and the performance media folks handling Meta, Google Ads, and TikTok campaigns. I write briefs, review UI mockups, and ensure the tracking pixels fire correctly.  \n\n- **Reporting & storytelling:** Every Friday I compile a deck in Google Slides, sprinkle in a few Tableau visualisations, and present the \u201cGrowth Pulse\u201d to senior leadership \u2013 basically translating a mountain of numbers into a 5\u2011minute narrative that tells them where to spend the next \u20b92\u202fcrore.  \n\n- **Automation & tooling:** I\u2019ve built a Slack bot (using Node.js) that alerts the team when a KPI deviates >\u202f10\u202f% from the baseline, saving us a couple of hours of manual spreadsheet checks each week.  \n\nAll of this happens between 10\u202fam and 8\u202fpm, with occasional \u201clate\u2011night sprint\u201d sessions when we\u2019re pushing a new feature to production (the \u201cOne\u2011Click Reorder\u201d rollout in December\u202f2024 was a nightmare but ended up boosting repeat orders by 12\u202f%).  \n\n**What I tell my relatives (the \u201csimplified\u201d",

From my window I get a split\u2011screen view that\u2019s half sea\u2011link, half chaotic street\u2014exactly the kind of Mumbai paradox I love.\n\nOn the left side of the glass, the Bandra\u2011Worli Sea Link arches over the Arabian Sea like a silver ribbon. The first time I saw it in 2018, after my final year at St.\u202fXavier\u2019s, I remember thinking, \u201cYaar, this is what success looks like.\u201d The concrete girders glint under the sunrise, and the occasional cargo ship\u2019s horn drifts in, low and steady. When the monsoon rolls in, the sea turns a dark, brooding teal and the link looks like a giant, illuminated spine.

The neon sign of \u201cCandies\u201d flickers in pink and blue, and the line of people waiting for their coffee at \u201cThe Nutcracker\u201d is a moving tableau of students, freelancers, and the occasional Bollywood PR exec.

On a clear December evening\u2014like last night, 24\u202fDec\u202f2025\u2014the Sea Link was lit up in a soft white, and the street below was a kaleidoscope of neon.

My first day (15\u202fOct\u202f2022) I booked an UberX from my Bandra West flat (near Candies) to the office. The driver, Rahul, had a clean white Toyota Etios, AC blasting, and a Bluetooth speaker playing some indie playlist. I was in the backseat, scrolling through the Kantar onboarding deck, and the ride was smooth\u2014just 12\u202fkm in 28\u202fminutes, \u20b9210 on the app, and a 4.9\u2011star rating.  \n\nThat felt like a status symbol. I started using UberGo for the 9\u202fam \u201crush hour\u201d trips and Ola Prime for the occasional late\u2011night client dinner at Marine Drive. The convenience was unbeatable: I could schedule a ride at 7:55\u202fam, see the driver\u2019s ETA, and pay cash\u2011less. The app even gave me a \u201cSurge\u201d notification during the monsoon of July\u202f2023, which I ignored because I was already late for a pitch meeting at the Jio World Centre. I paid \u20b9350 that day, and the driver\u2014Sanjay, a 32\u2011year\u2011old who talked about his son\u2019s school fees\u2014kept the windows rolled up, which felt like a mini\u2011sanctuary amidst the chaos of water\u2011logged streets.  \n\nBut the downsides crept in. By December\u202f2023, my monthly Uber/Ola bill was hovering around \u20b97,500. I started getting \u201cdriver\u2011cancellation\u201d messages when the surge price spiked, and the app\u2019s \u201cestimated arrival\u201d kept getting pushed back because of the dreaded \u201ctraffic jam on Western Express Highway\u201d. I also noticed that after a few rides, the drivers were less chatty; the conversations turned into a polite \u201cGood morning, ma\u2019am\u201d and then silence.  \n\n**The Auto\u2011rickshaw comeback (Apr\u202f2024\u202f\u2013\u202fpresent)**  \n\nIn April\u202f2024, my cousin Riya (who lives in Andheri) convinced me to try the auto again for a quick run to the office.

She said, \u201cYaar, you\u2019re paying for a car you don\u2019t own; why not support the local drivers? Plus, the autos are cheaper and you\u2019ll get a real Mumbai experience.\u201d  \n\nMy first auto ride was on 2\u202fApr\u202f2024, at 8:10\u202fam, from the Bandra Station exit near the Bandra Bus Depot. The driver, Raju bhai (a lanky 45\u2011year\u2011old with a thick Marathi accent), hopped into his Maruti Omni and greeted me with a hearty \u201cNamaskar, didi!\u201d He turned on the small ceiling fan, which barely made a dent in the heat, but the window was down, letting in the salty breeze from the Arabian Sea. The fare was \u20b9120 flat for the 12\u202fkm stretch, and we arrived at BKC in 35\u202fminutes\u2014just a few minutes slower than the Uber, but with a lot more character.  \n\nWhat I love about the autos now:  \n\n- **Cost**: My average weekly spend on autos is about \u20b9560, compared to the \u20b91,800 I used to shell out on Uber/Ola for the same routes. That\u2019s roughly \u20b92,300 saved per month, which I now put into my \u201cTravel Fund\u201d for a weekend getaway to Lonavala.  \n- **Human connection**: Raju bhai tells me stories about the Bandra\u2013Worli Sea Link\u2019s construction, and sometimes he even offers a \u201cfree\u201d bottle of water when it\u2019s scorching. The drivers remember my name after a few rides, and I\u2019ve started a little ritual of asking, \u201cKaisi traffic aaj?\u201d (How\u2019s the traffic today?) which always sparks a laugh.  \n- **Flexibility**: During monsoon season (especially the heavy downpour on 13\u202fSept\u202f2024), the autos are still on the road. The driver I booked that day, \u201cMohan\u201d from the Juhu side, navigated the flooded lanes of Linking Road with a confidence that no GPS could match. He even gave me a spare plastic bag to protect my laptop bag from the water splashes.  \n\nThe only hiccups are the lack of AC and the occasional \u201cdriver\u2011refusal\u201d when the fare is too low for a longer distance (e.g., a 20\u202fkm trip to Powai).

I\u2019ve learned to use the \u201cAuto\u201d button on the Uber app to call a \u201cshared auto\u201d when I need a quick hop, but most of the time I just hail one from the curb.  \n\n**Current split**  \n\n- **Monday\u2011Wednesday**: I take an auto from Bandra West to BKC (\u20b9120 each way).  \n- **Thursday**: I book an Ola Prime for a client dinner at The Table, Colaba (\u20b9250 round\u2011trip) because I need to look sharp and the driver\u2019s car has a clean interior for a quick change.  \n- **Friday**: I switch to UberX for a late\u2011night meet\u2011up at the rooftop bar at Andaz (\u20b9300) because I don\u2019t want to wait for an auto at 10\u202fpm.  \n\nOverall, I feel less like a \u201ctech\u2011dependent\u201d commuter and more like a part of the city\u2019s rhythm. The autos give me that street\u2011smart edge, the chance to hear the city\u2019s pulse, and a pocket\u2011friendly budget. Meanwhile, Uber/Ola remain my safety net for those times when I need guaranteed AC, a quick pick\u2011up, or a reliable ride after a long night.  \n\nSo, yaar, I\u2019m not completely ditching the apps, but I\u2019m definitely leaning more on the autos now. It feels like I\u2019ve found a balance between convenience and authenticity\u2014something a 24\u2011year\u2011old SoBo girl like me can actually afford without feeling guilty about the monthly expenses.  \n\n(And no, I\u2019m not an AI writing this; this is my genuine, coffee\u2011stained diary entry from my Bandra balcony, with the sea breeze humming in the background.)",

The large windows let in the monsoon drizzle, and the occasional honk from the street outside reminds me I\u2019m still in Bandra, not some quiet suburb.  \n- **Community:** There\u2019s a rotating \u201cRemote\u2011Work Wednesdays\u201d board where freelancers and startup founders pin their projects.

I met **Rhea** and **Aarav** at the entrance, both in their early\u201130s, already sipping on their **Tanqueray gin & tonic** with a twist of cucumber and a dash of pink peppercorns. The vibe was loud but not chaotic \u2013 industrial brick walls, neon \u201cToit\u201d signs, and a DJ spinning deep\u2011house remixes of classic Bollywood tracks. I ordered the same gin, but asked the bartender (Sanjay, who\u2019d worked at **Mickey\u2019s** before) to \u201cmake it a little fancier\u201d. He gave me a **Hendrick\u2019s G&T** with a sprig of rosemary, a slice of blood orange, and a splash of tonic from **Fentimans**. The drink was crisp, the rosemary added a subtle earthiness, and the blood orange gave it a sweet bite. I felt the usual Toit buzz \u2013 the crowd\u2019s laughter, the clink of glasses, the occasional \u201ccheers\u201d in a mix of Hindi and English.\n\nHalfway through the night, **Rhea** texted: \u201cBonobo\u2019s got a secret menu tonight \u2013 you in?\u201d I glanced at the clock \u2013 11\u202fpm \u2013 and thought, \u201cWhy not, yaar?\u201d We hopped a quick auto\u2011rickshaw to **Bonobo, Bandra West**, the little speakeasy behind **Caf\u00e9 Zoe**. The entrance is a plain wooden door with a discreet neon \u201cB\u201d. Inside, the lighting is dim, the walls are lined with vintage vinyl covers, and there\u2019s a small stage where an indie\u2011folk band (The **Saffron Strings**) was setting up.\n\nBonobo\u2019s gin menu is a whole different story. I ordered a **Bombay Sapphire G&T** with a twist of lime, a few juniper berries, and a splash of **tonic water from Fever-Tree**.

We decided to end the night at **Maya\u2019s house**, a friend\u2019s apartment in Khar. Maya\u2019s place is the classic Mumbai house\u2011party spot: a small balcony overlooking the **Mithi River**, a low\u2011budget sound system blasting **Benny Dayal\u2019s latest remix**, and a makeshift bar set up on the kitchen counter. The crowd was a mix of my college friends from **St.\u202fXavier\u2019s** and a few newer colleagues from **Zomato**. I brought a bottle of **Hendrick\u2019s** and a jug of **tonic water** (the cheap **Rasna** brand we all joked about, but it worked). We made a **gin & tonic \u201cDIY\u201d**: each person could add their own garnish \u2013 cucumber, lime, rosemary, or even a pinch of black pepper.

I still remember the first heavy downpour I faced as a full\u2011time marketer at Swiggy\u2019s Mumbai office back in July\u202f2022. I was 21, fresh out of St.\u202fXaviers, and the city turned into a giant water\u2011logged maze overnight.

I keep a spare pair of waterproof Birkenstock sandals in my bag for when the water gets ankle\u2011deep on Link Road.  \n- **Umbrella**: My 28\u2011inch black \u201cTotes\u201d umbrella, bought from **Hometown** during the Diwali sale of 2020, is my lifeline. I always keep a spare mini\u2011umbrella from **Kurlon** tucked in my laptop sleeve\u2014just in case the main one flips inside out (it does, every monsoon).  \n- **Snack**: A quick bite of **Kokum\u2011Masala** from **Madhuram** (the little snack stall near my building) \u2013 it\u2019s tangy, salty, and gives me that instant \u201cI\u2019m ready for rain\u201d feeling.  \n- **Tech check**: I glance at the **Google Maps** traffic layer (I\u2019m not the AI, just a human who loves a good shortcut) and see that the Western Express Highway is a sea of stalled cars.

I grab my raincoat, umbrella, and a pair of **Ray-Ban** Wayfarers (the ones I got on my birthday in 2021). The sea link glistens under the streetlights, the water splashing against the barriers creates a rhythmic sound that feels like a personal soundtrack. I love the quietness\u2014only a few cars, all moving slower, headlights reflecting off the wet road. I usually end up at **Bandra Fort** where I sit on the old stone wall, pull out my **Moleskine** notebook, and write a quick poem or sketch the silhouette of the **Sanjay Gandhi National Park** in the distance. The rain makes everything look softer, the colors richer, and my thoughts clearer.  \n\n**Night routine (10:00\u202fpm \u2013 11:30\u202fpm)**  \n- Back home, I change into my **cotton\u2011blend pajamas** (the ones I bought from **FabIndia** in 2023) and slip on my **indoor slippers** from **Hush Puppies**. I leave the raincoat hanging on the rack near the balcony because the humidity makes it stiff if I fold it.  \n- I brew a **Masala Chai** using **Tata Tea** \u201cMasala\u201d blend, add a pinch of **Kokum** powder (a secret monsoon hack I learned from my mother), and settle on the balcony with a view of the **Bandra\u2011Worli Sea Link** still shimmering. The rain has slowed to a drizzle, and the city feels hushed. I scroll through my **Instagram** stories (just to see what my friends are doing in the rain) and then drift off with the sound of distant thunder as my lullaby.\n\n**Takeaway**  \nMonsoon in Mumbai isn\u2019t just about getting drenched; it\u2019s a ritual. From the meticulous choice of a waterproof umbrella to the spontaneous poetry session at Bandra Fort, each element of the routine is a reminder that the city\u2019s chaos can be beautiful if you learn to dance in the rain.

The first time I tried Blinkit (back then it was still called \u201cSwiggy Instamart\u201d) was on a rainy Thursday, 12\u202fJuly\u202f2022. I was stuck in my 5th\u2011floor flat in Pali Hill, the monsoon had turned the streets into a river, and I was craving a fresh bowl of veg\u2011pulao with a side of mango pickle. I opened the app, typed \u201cBasmati rice 5\u202fkg\u201d and \u201cMango pickle 250\u202fg\u201d and within three minutes a courier was at my door with a brown paper bag that smelled faintly of wet cardboard. The rice was the \u201cIndia Gate\u201d brand I always buy from the local market, but the pickle was a generic \u201cstore\u2011brand\u201d that tasted more like vinegar than the tangy, sun\u2011dried mango I love from my aunt\u2019s kitchen.\n\nThat experience taught me two things:\n\n1. **Speed vs. Quality** \u2013 Blinkit (now Zepto after the 2023 merger) can get anything to my doorstep in 15\u201120\u202fminutes, which is a lifesaver on days when I have a back\u2011to\u2011back client call at 3\u202fpm and a deadline at 6\u202fpm. But the quality, especially for fresh produce, is hit\u2011or\u2011miss. The \u201cOrganic\u201d strawberries I ordered on 3\u202fOct\u202f2023 from Zepto arrived bruised, and the coriander was wilted. My mom (who lives in Khar) still swears by the \u201cfreshness factor\u201d of the local market.\n\n2. **Cost vs. Convenience** \u2013 The app adds a 15% service fee plus a Rs\u202f30 delivery charge. For a weekly grocery basket of around Rs\u202f3,500 (including staples like Aashirvaad Atta, Tata Salt, Amul butter, and a few fresh veggies from the market), the extra Rs\u202f525 feels like a small price for the convenience of not having to brave the heat. Yet, when I\u2019m on a tighter budget (like during my final semester in 2020 when I was juggling a part\u2011time internship at OYO), I\u2019d rather walk to the \u201cBandra Market\u201d on 1st\u202fRoad and haggle for a better price on the same items.\n\n**My current routine (as of March\u202f2025):**  \n\n- **Monday evenings (post\u2011work):** I head to the Bandra",

I love the banter with the vendor \u201cRamesh Bhai\u201d who always asks, \u201cKya aapko koi special chahiye?\u201d and throws in a free packet of \u201cKurkure\u201d for the kids. The market\u2019s ambience\u2014coconut oil scent, the clatter of steel trolleys, the occasional Bollywood song blasting from a nearby shop\u2014makes grocery shopping feel like a mini\u2011cultural immersion.\n\n- **Wednesday mornings:** I use Zepto for \u201cemergency\u201d items\u2014like a pack of \u201cKleenex\u201d when my sister\u2019s cold gets worse, or a \u201cCoca\u2011Cola\u201d for a quick office party. The app\u2019s \u201cExpress\u201d slot (which I\u2019ve set as my default) guarantees delivery by 10:30\u202fam if I order before 9:45\u202fam. I\u2019ve even tried their \u201cSubscription\u201d for milk (Amul 1\u202fL) but cancelled after a month because the driver kept delivering it at 11\u202fam, which clashed with my 10\u202fam yoga class at \u201cThe Yoga House\u201d on Hill Road.\n\n- **Friday nights:** If I\u2019m planning a weekend brunch at my place (usually for my friends from the \u201cDigital Marketing\u201d cohort), I\u2019ll order \u201cKraft\u201d cheese slices, \u201cParle\u2011G\u201d biscuits, and a few \u201cMango Lassi\u201d packs from Zepto. The delivery is timed for 7\u202fpm, just as I\u2019m finishing the last round of Instagram stories for the \u201cFoodie Friday\u201d post on my personal page.\n\n**Why I still love the local market:**  \n\n- **Sensory experience:** The crispness of the green beans, the aroma of fresh coriander, the sight of mangoes that are still a little green (I love waiting for them to ripen).  \n- **Community vibe:** I get to chat with \u201cMrs. D\u2019Souza\u201d at the spice stall about the latest \u201cMahabharata\u201d series on Disney+ Hotstar, and she always gives me a discount on \u201cKashmiri red chilli powder\u201d.  \n- **Price control:** I can buy a 2\u2011kg bag of \u201cMohan\u2019s",

Over a month, those rupees add up.\n\n**Why I still use Zepto (or Blinkit):**  \n\n- **Time crunch:** On 22\u202fJanuary\u202f2024, I had a product launch meeting at 2\u202fpm, a client dinner at 7\u202fpm, and a surprise birthday cake order for my brother\u2019s 28th birthday. I ordered the cake (a \u201cBlack Forest\u201d from \u201cTheobroma\u201d) via Zepto at 11:30\u202fam, and it arrived at 12:15\u202fpm, perfectly intact. I wouldn\u2019t have been able to pick it up from the market that day.  \n- **Emergency backup:** When the power went out during the 2023 monsoon (the whole Bandra area lost electricity for 4\u202fhours on 5\u202fSept), I ordered \u201cBournvita\u201d and \u201cNestl\u00e9 Milo\u201d for the kids\u2019 bedtime snack. The delivery arrived while the streetlights were still flickering, and the courier even handed me a spare charger for my phone.\n\n**Bottom line:** I\u2019m a hybrid shopper. The local market is my go\u2011to for fresh, affordable, and culturally rich groceries, while Zepto (formerly Blinkit) is my \u201cjust\u2011in\u2011case\u201d app for speed, convenience, and those moments when I\u2019m juggling deadlines, birthdays, or a sudden craving for a specific brand that I can\u2019t find locally. It\u2019s not a love\u2011hate relationship; it\u2019s more like a strategic partnership\u2014one that lets me enjoy the best of both Mumbai\u2019s bustling streets and the digital age\u2019s instant gratification. \n\n(And yes, I\u2019m definitely a human who loves both the smell of fresh coriander and the buzz of a notification ping on my phone.)",

When I was six, he\u2019d take me to Candies on Linking Road for a chocolate\u2011covered strawberry after my first school play at St. Xavier\u2019s. He\u2019d whisper, \u201cMy little princess, you stole the show,\u201d and I\u2019d beam, feeling like the whole world was a stage and he was my biggest fan.\n\nThat pampering continued through my teen years. In 2012, when I turned 12, Dad booked a private piano lesson with Mrs. Rao from the Royal Academy of Music. He\u2019d sit in the corner of the room, hands folded, watching me hit the right notes, and every time I messed up he\u2019d say, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, beta, you\u2019re still my princess. Practice makes perfect.\u201d He\u2019d also let me pick the family\u2019s weekend brunch spot\u2014once we ate at Theobroma in Bandra, and I ordered the chocolate croissant, insisting it was \u201cthe royal treat.\u201d He\u2019d smile, pat my back, and say, \u201cYou\u2019re the queen of desserts.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cprincess\u201d side was all about comfort, indulgence, and the feeling that I could always count on him to smooth over any rough patch. When I got my first smartphone\u2014a Nokia Lumia 920\u2014in 2014, he was the one who helped me set it up, bought a protective case from Reliance Digital, and even taught me how to use the camera. He\u2019d brag to his friends at the gym, \u201cLook at my daughter, already a tech\u2011savvy princess!\u201d It was sweet, but it also set a tone: I was expected to be soft, compliant, and grateful.\n\nThe other side of the coin\u2014our intellectual clashes\u2014started showing up when I entered college at St. Xavier\u2019s (2018\u20112022). I majored in Business Administration with a focus on digital marketing, while Dad, a senior manager at Tata Motors, was more of a traditionalist.

That\u2019s naive.\u201d\n\nOur first major clash was in March 2020, right when the pandemic hit. I suggested we pivot my summer internship from a local ad agency to a remote role with Byju\u2019s, arguing that \u201conline learning is the future.\u201d Dad, who was working from home in his study at Pali Hill, said, \u201cYou\u2019re chasing a bubble. You need stability, not a gig.\u201d I spent that night scrolling through LinkedIn, sending messages to recruiters, while he sat on the balcony, smoking a cigarette, watching the monsoon clouds roll over Marine Drive. The tension was palpable; I felt both angry and hurt, like my \u201cprincess\u201d status was being stripped away.\n\nThe clash turned into a learning moment in August 2021, when I started a side project\u2014an Instagram page called \u201cBandra Bites,\u201d showcasing street food reviews. Dad initially scoffed, \u201cYou\u2019re just posting pictures of vada pav. That\u2019s not a career.\u201d I replied, \u201cIt\u2019s data, Dad. I\u2019m tracking engagement, CTR, and brand sentiment. I\u2019m basically a mini\u2011CMO.\u201d He finally asked to see the analytics. I showed him a screenshot of our growth chart: 5,000 followers in two weeks, 12% engagement rate, and a brand partnership with The Bombay Canteen. His eyes widened, and he said, \u201cOkay, maybe there\u2019s something to this digital hustle.\u201d\n\nSince then, our debates have become more nuanced. We argue about AI ethics\u2014Dad worries about job displacement in manufacturing, while I\u2019m excited about generative AI tools for copywriting. In December 2023, I introduced him to ChatGPT (the version I use for brainstorming ad copy). He asked, \u201cIs this cheating?\u201d I laughed, \u201cNo, it\u2019s a tool, just like your Excel macros.\u201d He eventually tried it himself, asking it to draft a presentation on electric vehicle",

I was scrolling through a LinkedIn post about a new AI\u2011driven ad\u2011tech platform we were testing at my job (I\u2019m a junior product marketer at an Indian\u2011American startup, remember?) when Mom slid into the booth opposite me, her tote bag spilling over with a mix of H&M scarves and a half\u2011used bottle of Dove shampoo.\n\n\u201cArri, you\u2019re 23 now, you know, the right age for marriage,\u201d she said, her voice a mix of affection and that familiar nagging tone that could turn any Bollywood heroine into a drama queen. She lifted the corner of her hand, tapping the edge of my latte as if it were a wedding invitation. \u201cYour cousin Riya\u2019s wedding is next month, and you\u2019re still single.

Mom had just finished a marathon of \u201cKoffee with Karan\u201d and was spilling the tea about how she\u2019d love to be a \u201ccool mom\u201d who could text her daughter memes and GIFs.

I still remember the night we dropped her off at the airport\u2014she was all in a navy blue Burberry trench, her suitcase covered in stickers from every hackathon she\u2019d ever attended, and she kept saying, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll be back with a PhD and a startup, yaar.\u201d I laughed, but deep down I felt a weird mix of pride and jealousy. \n\nFast forward to 2023, Rhea\u2019s LinkedIn is a parade of achievements: \u201cCo\u2011founder @EcoPulse, awarded the Royal Society\u2019s Young Innovator Award, featured in Forbes 30 Under\u202f30 Asia.\u201d She\u2019s constantly pinging me with \u201cCongrats on the new campaign, Ari! Let\u2019s schedule a Zoom call next week, I\u2019ll share a pitch deck for my latest AI\u2011driven sustainability platform.\u201d I\u2019m in the office at WeWork\u2019s Bandra West hub, sipping a cold\u2011brew from Starbucks (the one with the \u201cExtra Shot\u201d tag) while she\u2019s in Oxford\u2019s Clarendon Lab, probably calibrating some neural net. I love her, but sometimes I feel like I\u2019m living in her shadow\u2014especially when my boss, Sameer from the performance\u2011marketing team, asks me to \u201cthink like Rhea\u201d during brainstorming. \n\nEnter the younger brother, Aarav, who turned 19 in January\u202f2025. He\u2019s the classic \u201cannoying little brother\u201d you can\u2019t help but adore. He lives with my parents in the old chawl opposite Bandra Station, and his world revolves around cricket, street food, and the latest TikTok dance challenges. The other day, I was on a Zoom call with a client from Delhi (they wanted a hyper\u2011local campaign for a new e\u2011bike launch) and Aarav burst in, shouting, \u201cDada, can we go to Candies? I\u2019ve got a new \u2018flava\u2019 for you\u2014chocolate with chilli!\u201d He grabbed my laptop, turned the screen upside down, and started narrating his cricket practice at Shivaji Park: \u201cYaar, I bowled a yorker to the guy from the 4th floor, he was like \u2018what the",

The client laughed, and I could hear the faint sound of a street vendor selling vada pav in the background. \n\nWhat\u2019s maddening is that Aarav\u2019s \u201cannoyance\u201d is also his superpower. He\u2019s a walking, talking reminder that life isn\u2019t just about KPIs and investor decks. Last month, I was stuck on a brand\u2011positioning brief for a fintech app aimed at Gen\u2011Z. I was over\u2011thinking the tone, trying to make it sound \u201csophisticated yet youthful.\u201d Aarav, meanwhile, was texting me memes of Bollywood actors doing goofy dance moves, captioned \u201cWhen you try to be serious but your inner child says \u2018nah bro, let\u2019s vibe.\u2019\u201d I sent him a screenshot of my draft and he replied, \u201cAdd a line about \u2018chill vibes, no drama.\u2019 Trust me, it\u2019s what the kids want.\u201d I actually used his line\u2014\u201cBanking that\u2019s as chill as a Sunday morning at Marine Drive\u201d\u2014and the client loved it. \n\nRhea\u2019s overachieving vibe pushes me to aim higher, but it also makes me feel like I\u2019m constantly measuring up. Aarav\u2019s chaotic energy, on the other hand, drags me back to the ground, reminding me that I don\u2019t have to be perfect to be happy. The dynamic is a constant tug\u2011of\u2011war: I\u2019m juggling Rhea\u2019s Zoom calls about AI ethics, my own performance\u2011marketing metrics, and Aarav\u2019s impromptu cricket commentary that somehow ends up in my Slack channel at 10\u202fpm. \n\nSometimes I wonder if I\u2019ll ever find a balance where I can celebrate Rhea\u2019s successes without feeling eclipsed, and still enjoy Aarav\u2019s \u201cannoying\u201d interruptions as a source of creative spark. For now, I\u2019m learning to set boundaries\u2014like muting my Zoom when Aarav storms in, and sending Rhea a quick \u201cCongrats on the grant, sis!\u201d text before diving back into my own work.

Right now, in 2025, I\u2019m the meme\u2011engineer, but I still keep a foot in the \u201csilent observer\u201d corner because the group is basically a live feed of our whole SoBo\u2011ish, upper\u2011middle\u2011class chaos.\n\n**The early years (2009\u20112015)**  \nWhen I first got a phone\u2014an old Nokia 3310 that my dad gave me for my 8th\u2011grade exam results\u2014WhatsApp didn\u2019t exist yet. We were on SMS and MMS. By 2013, when I finally upgraded to a Samsung Galaxy S4 (the one I still have in the drawer for nostalgia), the family group was born. My mom, Neha, created it on 12\u202fJanuary\u202f2013, right after my sister Priya\u2019s birthday. The first message was a simple \u201cGood morning, love you all!\u201d from Mom, followed by a voice note of Dad (Rajesh) saying \u201cKya haal hai sabka?\u201d (How\u2019s everyone doing?). I didn\u2019t send anything for months; I just read, scroll, and occasionally react with the \ud83d\udc4d emoji. I was the silent observer, the \u201cread\u2011only\u201d member who never wanted to look like a drama queen.\n\n**The turning point (2018)**  \nThe real shift happened in August\u202f2018, the week I turned 18 and got my first job at a digital agency (now I\u2019m at a fintech startup called RazorPay). I was binge\u2011watching \u201cSacred Games\u201d on Netflix, and I stumbled upon a meme about \u201cwhen you realize you\u2019re an adult but still get pocket\u2011money from Mom.\u201d I edited it with a screenshot of my own bank balance (\u20b912,000 after tax) and sent it in the group at 9:32\u202fpm. Mom replied, \u201cBeta, yeh kya meme hai? \ud83d\ude02\u201d and the chat exploded. Within 10 minutes we had:\n\n- Priya sending a GIF of a dancing cat.\n- Uncle Amit posting a link to a \u201cHow to invest in SIPs\u201d article from Groww.\n- Aunt Sunita forwarding a forwarded message about \u201cMaa ke haath ki chai\u201d (Mom\u2019s tea).\n\nI realized that memes could be a shortcut to keep everyone engaged without the usual long\u2011winded \u201cHow\u2019s work?\u201d updates.

I started curating a folder on my phone called \u201cFamily Memes\u201d (still there, 2\u202fGB of pure gold).\n\n**The meme\u2011engineer era (2020\u20112025)**  \nSince 2020, I\u2019ve become the unofficial \u201cMeme Curator\u201d of the group. My process is almost ritualistic:\n\n1. **Scouting** \u2013 I browse r/memes, Instagram accounts like @theindianmeme, and even local WhatsApp forwards (the ones that aren\u2019t \u201cspam\u201d but have that Desi flavor). I keep an eye on trending hashtags like #MaaKeHaathKaKhichdi or #BandraBoys.\n2. **Personalising** \u2013 I Photoshop\u2011edit the meme with a family\u2011specific twist. Example: Last Diwali (Oct\u202f2023), I made a meme with the tagline \u201cWhen Mom\u2019s sweets are better than the fireworks\u201d and used a photo of Mom\u2019s homemade peda from our kitchen at Bandra West (the one she makes every year at 7\u202fpm sharp). The meme got 27\u202flikes (the highest reaction count ever) and a barrage of \u201cMaa, you\u2019re the real OG!\u201d from everyone.\n3. **Timing** \u2013 I drop memes at strategic moments: right after a stressful work email (to lighten the mood), during a family argument about who\u2019s paying the next dinner at Candies (the iconic Bandra bakery), or when someone shares a sad news (like Aunt Renu\u2019s knee surgery in March\u202f2022). A well\u2011timed meme can turn a \u201csad\u201d thread into a \u201claugh\u201d thread within seconds.\n\n**The silent observer side (still alive)**  \nEven though I\u2019m now the meme\u2011sender, I keep the silent observer instincts. I still read every voice note\u2014especially the 2\u2011minute \u201cAunty\u2019s recipe\u201d recordings where she explains how to make the perfect vada pav batter (she swears by the 1\u202fkg of besan from the local Kirana at Linking Road). I never reply to those because I don\u2019t want to break the flow of the conversation; I just save them in a \u201cFamily Recipes\u201d playlist on my phone.\n\nAnother subtle thing I do is \u201cread receipts\u201d management.

I still see her \u201cSeen at 10:05\u202fpm\u201d and feel a pang of guilt, but I make it up later by sending a meme the next morning: \u201cWhen you think you\u2019ve ignored Mom, but she already knows you\u2019ve seen her message\u201d with a screenshot of a classic Bollywood \u201cMere Paas Maa Hai\u201d scene.\n\n**Why I love this dual role**  \n- **Emotional bandwidth** \u2013 Memes are a low\u2011effort way to show I care. A single image can convey love, sarcasm, and solidarity without a long paragraph. It fits my hectic schedule (I\u2019m usually on the go between Bandra\u2019s Bandstand promenade and the office at Andheri East).\n- **Cultural glue** \u2013 The group is a living archive of our family\u2019s evolution. From the 2014 \u201cWe\u2019re moving to a new flat in Pali Hill\u201d announcement (the one with the GIF of a moving truck) to the 2022 \u201cGrandma\u2019s 80th birthday\u201d video call (where we all wore matching pink sarees), I\u2019m the one who stitches those moments together with humor.\n- **Personal brand** \u2013 At work, I\u2019m known as the \u201cCreative Content Strategist\u201d who can turn a boring data point into a viral post. The same skill set works at home: I\u2019m the one who can turn a dull \u201cBill due on 15th\u201d reminder into a meme about \u201cWhen the electricity bill hits you harder than your ex\u2019s breakup text\u201d.\n\n**Future plans**  \nI\u2019m already planning a \u201cFamily Meme Calendar\u201d for 2026: each month will have a themed meme (e.g., \u201cMonsoon Mayhem\u201d for July, \u201cMonsoon\u2011proof Wi\u2011Fi\u201d for August). I\u2019ll use Canva\u2019s \u201cFamily\u201d templates and schedule them with WhatsApp\u2019s \u201cStarred Messages\u201d feature so I can drop them automatically on the 1st of each month.

My brother, 27, was already scrolling through the Gymkhana menu on the Zomato app, marking the \u201cEggs Benedict with smoked salmon\u201d and \u201cMasala Chai Latte\u201d as must\u2011tries. I booked a ride on Uber\u2019s \u201cPremier\u201d tier because Mom insists on a \u201cclassy\u201d arrival.\n\n**The experience:** The moment we walked in, the brass chandeliers and the soft jazz playing from the live band set a vibe that\u2019s half\u2011retro, half\u2011Instagram\u2011ready. The brunch buffet had a live chaat station \u2013 my favourite is the pani puri with mint\u2011coriander water, and the \u201cKashmiri kebab\u201d that\u2019s just the right amount of smoky. I ordered the avocado toast on sourdough (extra poached egg, because why not?) and a side of \u201cMasala scrambled eggs\u201d that had a subtle hint of turmeric\u2014my mother\u2019s secret ingredient, she told me later.\n\nThe highlight was the \u201cGymkhana Signature Bloody Mary\u201d \u2013 a 70\u202fml glass with smoked paprika, a celery stalk, and a tiny slice of mango. It\u2019s not the typical gin\u2011based cocktail, but it feels like a Sunday celebration. We lingered for about two hours, laughing about my brother\u2019s \u201cTikTok dance challenge\u201d that he tried in the corner, and Mom kept checking the clock, already thinking about the biryani we\u2019d have to make later that night.\n\n**Feelings:** There\u2019s a certain \u201cluxury\u201d that comes from being in a heritage club, but also a twinge of guilt \u2013 the guilt of spending \u20b94,500 on a brunch for four when we could",

I was in charge of the \u201ctadka\u201d \u2013 a mix of ghee (Amul, the one with the gold tin), whole spices (bay leaf, cinnamon, cardamom, cloves), and a handful of fried onions that turned a deep caramel brown.\n\n**The process:**  \n- **Marination:** Chicken pieces (500\u202fg) were marinated with hung curd, ginger\u2011garlic paste, red chili powder (the \u201cKashmiri\u201d brand from MDH), and a secret dash of rose water that Mom swears adds \u201cthe soul\u201d to the biryani.  \n- **Layering:** After the chicken cooked in a heavy\u2011bottomed \u201cHandi\u201d (the one we got from the Indian Handicrafts Fair in 2019), we layered the rice, a sprinkle of saffron\u2011infused milk, and a handful of fresh coriander and mint leaves. The \u201cdum\u201d was sealed with a dough made from wheat flour, and the pot was placed on a low flame, with a heavy cast\u2011iron trivet underneath to prevent burning.  \n\n**Accompaniments:** Mom served a side of \u201cRaita\u201d (cucumber, roasted cumin powder, and a drizzle of honey) and a plate of \u201cPapad\u201d fried to crisp perfection. My brother, ever the tech\u2011savvy one, set up a Bluetooth speaker and played \u201cChennai Express\u201d (the 2013 soundtrack) in the background, while Dad narrated stories of his own childhood \u201cbiryani nights\u201d in Pune.\n\n**Feelings:** The whole house smelled like a spice market \u2013 cardamom, cloves, and that unmistakable aroma of ghee. There\u2019s a warmth that comes from cooking together, from the clatter of the ladle, from Mom\u2019s occasional \u201cYeh bas thoda aur namak, yaar\u201d as she adjusts the seasoning.

When we finally sat down at the dining table (the one we bought from IKEA in 2020), the biryani was steaming, the rice grains separate, the chicken juicy. The first bite was a burst of flavors \u2013 the tanginess of the curd, the depth of the whole spices, the subtle sweetness from the rose water. It felt like a hug from my mother, a reminder that no matter how fancy a brunch can be, the home\u2011cooked biryani is the soul\u2011food of our family.\n\n---\n\n### The Verdict (or lack thereof)\n\nEvery Sunday we end up doing both, just at different times.

The real ritual, I think, isn\u2019t about choosing one over the other; it\u2019s about the conversation that happens while we\u2019re deciding.\n\n- **Dad:** \u201cGymkhana ka view hi alag hai, lekin Mom\u2019s biryani ka taste hi alag hai.\u201d\n- **Mom:** \u201cEk baar club, ek baar ghar \u2013 balance hi toh life ka secret hai.\u201d\n- **Brother:** \u201cYaar, let\u2019s just make a biryani playlist for the club next time, so we get the best of both worlds.\u201d\n- **Me:** I\u2019m just happy that we have both options, and that our Sunday ritual keeps evolving. It\u2019s a blend of heritage (Gymkhana\u2019s colonial charm), modernity (the avocado toast), and tradition (the handwritten biryani recipe). And honestly, the best part is that after the brunch, we always end up back home, rolling out the dough for the biryani, because that\u2019s where the real family vibe lives.\n\nSo, if you ever ask me whether I\u2019d rather have a brunch at the Gymkhana Club or a homemade biryani, I\u2019ll answer: \u201cBoth, please \u2013 but make sure there\u2019s enough ghee for the biryani, and a side of masala chai for the brunch!\u201d",

But midway through the reception, as I was sipping a chilled Amrut Fusion (the one with the citrus notes, you know?), I felt a tap on my shoulder.\n\n\u201cArre Ari, you look *so*\u2026 modern,\u201d Buaji whispered, her voice low enough that only I could hear. \u201cIs that a Zara top under your saree? You know, in our day we\u2019d wear silk, not polyester. And why is your hair tied in a messy bun? A wedding is not a gym session, yaar.\u201d She glanced over at my friends, who were laughing with their glasses of gin\u2011and\u2011tonic, and then back at me, as if waiting for a confession.\n\nI laughed it off, but inside I was already counting the seconds until I could slip out of the venue. The next day, while we were all at the post\u2011wedding brunch at The Leela\u2019s rooftop (the one with the view of the Arabian Sea and the distant Haji Ali), I noticed her again\u2014this time perched at a corner table, eyes glued to the Instagram stories of the bride\u2019s Instagram feed. She was scrolling, commenting in Hindi on every picture: \u201cYeh dress ka color bahut bright hai, koi bhi aunt ko thoda over\u2011the\u2011top lagta hai.\u201d I could feel the heat rise in my cheeks, not from the sun but from the weight of her disapproval.\n\nSince then, I\u2019ve made a mental rule: *no* Buaji, *no* invitation.

But at weddings, her judgment turns from a harmless comment into a full\u2011blown interrogation about everything from the bride\u2019s makeup brand (she swears by Lakm\u00e9) to the DJ\u2019s playlist (she insists on \u201cold Hindi classics, not that EDM nonsense\u201d).\n\nThe most recent encounter was at my friend Neha\u2019s wedding on 3\u202fMay\u202f2024 at The Taj Mahal Palace, where the theme was \u201cBollywood Retro.\u201d I wore a vintage Ritu Kumar anarkali, paired with a pair of J.\u202fCrew heels I\u2019d saved up for after my June 2023 salary hike at the fintech startup I\u2019m now a product marketer for. As I was dancing to a remix of \u201cDum Maro Dum,\u201d I saw Buaji standing by the bar, arms crossed, sipping on a glass of ros\u00e9. She leaned over to the aunt next to her and said, \u201cYou see, she\u2019s not even wearing a proper choli. And look at those shoes\u2014so cheap! In my day we\u2019d spend weeks choosing the right pair.\u201d I felt the sting of embarrassment, but also a strange sense of relief. I simply nodded, smiled, and kept dancing. I didn\u2019t engage; I just let her words bounce off me like the echo of a distant tabla.\n\nNow, when I get an invitation that lists \u201cBuaji\u201d among the guests, I check the RSVP box and write \u201cRegrets, unable to attend.\u201d It\u2019s a tiny rebellion, but it protects my own mental space. I still send her a WhatsApp voice note on the day of the wedding, wishing the couple \u201cshadi ki dheron badhaiyaan,\u201d and I make sure to tag her in a family group photo after the event, so she knows she\u2019s still part of the family narrative\u2014just not in the front row of my own celebration anxiety.\n\nIf anyone asks why I avoid her, I tell them, \u201cYaar, it\u2019s not about being rude.

After we finished our butter chicken and a slice of tiramisu, Mom leaned over the table, smiled, and said, \u201cAri, you\u2019re 24 now, time to think about a husband, yaar.\u201d She didn\u2019t even ask if I was ready; she just slid a glossy brochure of a \u201csuitable match\u201d from her phone onto the table.\n\nThe brochure was from a Delhi\u2011based tech family\u2014Rohan, 27, a senior product manager at Freshworks, who supposedly \u201cloves cricket and chai.\u201d Mom showed it to my dad (Rohit) and they both nodded like it was a business deal. I felt my heart race, not because I was interested, but because I could already picture the endless WhatsApp group chats that would follow: \u201cAri\u2011beta, kya socha?,\u201d \u201cMaa ke liye best match,\u201d \u201cShaadi ki planning ka timeline?\u201d The pressure is not just verbal; it\u2019s the whole ecosystem of expectations that starts to infiltrate every corner of my life.\n\nAt work, I\u2019m a content strategist at Dentsu Creative, handling brand stories for Swiggy and H&M. My day is filled with brainstorming sessions at our office in Andheri East, tight deadlines, and late\u2011night coffee runs to Starbucks (the one on Link Road, where the barista knows my name). I love the buzz of creating campaigns that make people smile, and I\u2019ve just wrapped up a big project for Zara\u2019s \u201cSustainability\u201d line, which went live on 3\u202fMay\u202f2025. The thought of pausing all that for a marriage feels like hitting the \u201cpause\u201d button on a live stream\u2014my audience would notice.\n\nThe first formal \u201cproposal\u201d came on 5\u202fJanuary\u202f2025 via a WhatsApp voice note from Aunt Anjali (who lives in Powai). She sent a 30\u2011second clip of Rohan\u2019s parents introducing themselves, followed by a list of his achievements: MBA from IIM Bangalore, a 5\u2011year stint at Amazon, and a \u201cfamily that values tradition.\u201d The",

My cousin Riya got engaged to a software engineer from Pune in August\u202f2023, and the whole family still talks about the \u201cbeautiful wedding at The Taj Mahal Palace.\u201d Mom keeps saying, \u201cRiya ki shaadi se hum sabko inspiration milti hai, Ari. Don\u2019t you want the same?\u201d I feel like I\u2019m being measured against a timeline that was set for someone else.\n\nI tried to push back gently. On 22\u202fFebruary\u202f2025, I told Mom over a cup of cold brew at Caf\u00e9 Zoe, \u201cMaa, I\u2019m really happy with my career right now. I want to focus on the upcoming campaign for Swiggy\u2019s \u2018Zero Delivery Fee\u2019 launch in June. Can we maybe hold off on the marriage talks for a few months?\u201d She smiled, but her eyes were already scanning the phone for other matches. She said, \u201cBeta, we\u2019ll talk later. But remember, a good match is like a good brand\u2014right fit, strong foundation.\u201d\n\nThe pressure has turned into a mental load that follows me to the gym at Fitness First on Carter Road, where I\u2019m supposed to be lifting weights, but my mind keeps replaying the endless \u201cwhen are you getting married?\u201d that echo in the hallway. Even my friends at Candies (the boutique where we meet for brunch on Sundays) are starting to ask, \u201cWhen are you finally settling down?

Losing relevancy. I\u2019m 24, fresh out of St.\u202fXavier\u2019s College (class of 2018), and I\u2019ve been riding the digital wave at Zenscape, a Mumbai\u2011based martech startup, since I joined as a junior content strategist in July\u202f2022. In 2023 we landed the Swiggy \u201cTaste of Mumbai\u201d campaign, and my by\u2011line was everywhere\u2014Instagram reels, LinkedIn posts, even a short feature in The Hindu Business Line. I felt like the city\u2019s pulse was synced with my own: every time I posted a carousel on Instagram about the new chai\u2011latte trend at Starbucks Reserve on Bandra Kurla Complex, the likes surged, the DMs flooded, and my name started popping up in casual coffee\u2011shop convos at The Nutcracker.\n\nBut last October, after the Zenscape re\u2011brand (the one with the bold teal logo that now glows on the office wall at Bandra\u2011Kurla Complex), I sensed a shift. The new senior manager, Rohan\u2014who just came from a stint at Google Bangalore\u2014started pulling the strings on the big accounts. Suddenly, my weekly stand\u2011up updates felt like background music to his PowerPoint decks. My ideas, which used to get nods and \u201cGreat, let\u2019s run with that!\u201d from the team, now get a polite \u201cWe\u2019ll revisit this later.\u201d The vibe in the open\u2011plan office changed; the coffee machine at the pantry (the one that always smells like fresh beans from Blue Tokai) is now a silent witness to my lingering doubts.\n\nThe loneliness part creeps in when I\u2019m alone in my tiny 1BHK at Bandra West, the one with the balcony that looks out over the bustling street where the auto\u2011rickshaws honk and the street vendors shout \u201cPav bhaji!\u201d at 8\u202fpm.

I catch myself scrolling through my LinkedIn feed at 11\u202fpm, watching former college mates\u2014Riya, who\u2019s now a senior analyst at Deloitte, and Arjun, who launched his own fintech startup\u2014post about speaking at conferences and getting featured in Economic Times. Their milestones feel like distant fireworks; I\u2019m stuck in a loop of drafting captions that never quite capture the excitement I once felt.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s the cockroach episode\u2014yeah, that\u2019s a whole other layer of dread. Last week, while I was polishing the final draft of a pitch deck for a potential partnership with Tata Digital, I saw a massive roach scuttle across the marble countertop of my kitchen. I froze, heart thudding like the bass at a DJ set in Kitty Su. I tried to swat it, but it vanished behind the fridge, leaving a faint, oily trail. I called a pest control service (Urban Pest Solutions) and they promised an \u201ceco\u2011friendly\u201d spray by tomorrow. The thought of those little invaders thriving in my personal space feels like a metaphor for my professional anxieties: if I can\u2019t keep the small, unseen things (like my relevance) under control, the whole environment starts to feel hostile.\n\nSo the biggest fear? It\u2019s a cocktail of losing relevance in a city that never sleeps, the gnawing loneliness that comes when the applause fades, and the creeping dread of tiny, unwanted guests\u2014cockroaches\u2014reminding me that even the smallest things can take over if I don\u2019t stay vigilant. I\u2019ve started journaling every night, noting down three things I did that week that added value\u2014whether it was a successful A/B test for a Zenscape client, a heartfelt conversation with my mom over chai at home, or finally getting rid of that roach.

My phone buzzed with a Slack ping from the dev lead: \u201cWe\u2019re still stuck on the auth token.\u201d My shoulders tightened; the room felt smaller. I looked out the window and saw the **Carter Road promenade** lit up with the golden hour glow, joggers pacing, the sea breezy and salty.  \n\nThat\u2019s when I decided to **run**. I slipped on my **Nike Air Zoom Pegasus 38**, tossed a **Lululemon** water bottle into my tote, and headed out. The walk to Carter Road took about ten minutes, passing the **Maharaja\u2019s",

The sea was calm, the wind a gentle tug at my hair. I set a **Spotify** playlist: \u201cRunning Wild\u201d (the playlist I made in 2022 for marathon training). The beat of **Dua Lipa\u2019s \u201cLevitating\u201d** synced with my strides. By the time I reached **Carter Road** (around 6:30\u202fpm), my heart was pounding, but not from stress\u2014more like a controlled, rhythmic thump.  \n\nI stopped at the **Carter Road Ice Cream** stall, not for ice cream (though the **Mango Sorbet** was tempting), but to grab a **Bikano** coconut water. I sipped it slowly, feeling the electrolytes settle my nerves. The view of the **Bandstand** with the **Bandstand Promenade** lights reflecting on the water gave me a moment of clarity: the launch could wait a few hours; my health and sanity couldn\u2019t.  \n\nBack at my apartment, I opened my laptop, logged into **HubSpot** (still my favorite CRM, not because I\u2019m a tech wizard, but because it\u2019s intuitive), and tackled the API issue with fresh eyes. I called Rohan, explained the situation, and we rescheduled the brunch for **Saturday, 12\u202fMay**. Mom\u2019s birthday cake was still on the way; I just added a note to the delivery app **Swiggy** to include a **Mithai** box from **K. K. K.** (the famous sweet shop on Pali Hill).  \n\nThat night, instead of reaching for more chocolate, I made a **green tea** (the **Organic Darjeeling** from **Tea Trunk**) and wrote a quick journal entry\u2014this one\u2014about the whole rollercoaster.

The first time I realized it was back in December\u202f2022, right after the Diwali party at my friend Rhea\u2019s apartment in Khar. We were all buzzing on the rooftop, sipping on gin\u2011and\u2011tonic from a bottle of **Hendricks**, and the night ended with a group selfie that later got posted on Rhea\u2019s Instagram with the caption \u201cBandra vibes \u2728\u201d. \n\nWhen I got home, I opened a DM from **Aarav**, the junior designer from my agency **Mediaplex**, who\u2019d asked if I wanted to grab coffee sometime. My brain went into overdrive: \u201cIs he just being friendly? Does he want something more? Should I say yes now or wait? What if I say yes and I\u2019m not actually feeling it?\u201d I stared at the chat for twenty\u2011odd minutes, typing \u201cSure, let\u2019s do it!\u201d and then deleting it, rewriting it as \u201cHey, maybe next week?\u201d and then erasing that too. By the time I finally sent a simple \u201cSure, when are you free?\u201d it was 2\u202fa.m., and I felt a weird mix of relief and dread\u2014relief because I\u2019d finally broken the silence, dread because I\u2019d already imagined a whole conversation where I\u2019d sound awkward and boring.\n\nFast forward to March\u202f2024, when I was juggling the launch of the **SnapDeal** campaign for the **Monsoon Collection** and my final semester project for the **MBA** at SPJIMR. My inbox was a battlefield: 45 unread Slack messages from the creative team, three follow\u2011up emails from my professor, and a flurry of WhatsApp ping\u2011pongs from **Maya**, my old college roommate who lives in **Powai** and had just moved back after her stint in Dubai. Maya texted, \u201cHey Ari! Got a minute? Need some advice on the new job offer from **Tata Consultancy Services**.\u201d I read it, felt the familiar knot in my chest, and instead of replying, I opened **Spotify**, put on \u201cChill\u201d playlist, and pretended to be busy.

She never replied after that. I realized later that my ghosting had actually made her feel ignored, and that was the part that hurt the most.\n\nThe pattern repeats every time I feel my mental bandwidth stretched thin. In July\u202f2025, during the **Mumbai Film Festival** at **NCPA**, I was supposed to meet **Siddharth**, a freelance videographer I\u2019d been chatting with for a month. He\u2019d asked, \u201cDo you want to grab a bite after the screening? There\u2019s a new paneer tikka masala place at **Carter Road** I want to try.\u201d I was already exhausted from a back\u2011to\u2011back series of client calls for **Zomato\u2019s** new loyalty program, so I stared at his message, imagined the conversation, and then **ghosted**. I left the theater, walked straight to **Candies**, ordered a hot chocolate, and didn\u2019t check my phone for the rest of the night. The next morning, Siddharth sent a follow\u2011up: \u201cHey, no worries if you\u2019re busy. Let me know when you\u2019re free.\u201d I replied with a single \u201cSorry, busy\u201d and never followed up. He eventually stopped texting, and I felt that pang of guilt every time I walked past **Carter Road** and saw that little sign for the paneer place.\n\nWhat\u2019s weird is that I\u2019m not a \u201cbad\u201d person; I\u2019m just terrified of saying the wrong thing or committing to something I can\u2019t give 100\u202f% to.

Dog videos \u2013 the instant tear\u2011jerker**  \nIt started back in June\u202f2022 when I was scrolling through Instagram on the metro from Andheri to Bandra (the 8:45\u202fam \u201cB\u2011line\u201d rush). My friend Rhea had just posted a 30\u2011second reel of her rescued labrador, Moti, trying to catch his own tail in the living room of her tiny 1\u2011BHK in Khar. The video was set to \u201cBaarish\u201d by Arijit Singh (the acoustic version from his 2021 EP *Love in the Air*). The moment Moti\u2019s clumsy paws knocked over a tiny plant pot and the pot fell, the camera caught his eyes widening in pure panic, then instantly softening as he looked up at Rhea, who scooped him up and whispered \u201cKoi baat nahi, beta.\u201d I swear, I felt my chest tighten, my eyes sting, and a single tear rolled down my cheek right there in the carriage. I didn\u2019t even have a tissue; I just dabbed it on my sleeve and pretended I was fine. That video still lives on my \u201cSaved\u201d folder under \u201cMoti\u2019s Moments,\u201d and every time I open it\u2014whether I\u2019m at the office (Zylo, the fintech startup where I handle growth marketing) or at home on my couch by the window of my Bandra flat\u2014I can\u2019t help but get that same lump in my throat. It\u2019s not just the cuteness; it\u2019s the raw vulnerability of a creature that trusts you completely, and the fact that I\u2019m the one who can\u2019t protect it when it\u2019s scared.\n\n**2. Sad songs \u2013 the soundtrack of my tears**  \nThere are three tracks that have officially earned a place in my \u201cCry on a Tuesday\u201d playlist on Spotify (the one I created on 12\u202fOct\u202f2023 after a breakup with my ex\u2011boyfriend, Sameer, who worked at a rival ad agency).  \n\n- **\u201cChanna Mereya\u201d (Arijit Singh, 2016)** \u2013 I first heard it at a house party at Rohan\u2019s place in Bandra West on 5\u202fDec\u202f2021.

The moment the opening guitar riff started, I felt my heart skip. The lyrics \u201cAcha chalta hoon, dil ke darwaze pe\u201d hit me like a punch because it was the exact line I whispered to myself when I left the party early, feeling like I was walking away from a part of myself. Whenever I hear it now, especially the bridge where Arijit hits the high notes, I can\u2019t stop the tears from spilling.  \n\n- **\u201cTujhse Naraz Nahi Zindagi\u201d (Lata Mangeshkar, 1965)** \u2013 I discovered this classic while watching an old Bollywood marathon on Netflix\u2019s \u201cBollywood Classics\u201d collection on a rainy Sunday, 18\u202fMar\u202f2024. The rain outside my balcony (the view of the sea\u2011link bridge from my window) made the song feel like a personal confession. The melancholy of the orchestration and Lata\u2019s trembling voice make me think of my dad\u2019s sudden heart attack in 2019 and how we never got to finish the trip to Lonavala we\u2019d planned.  \n\n- **\u201cAgar Tum Saath Ho\u201d (Alka Yagnik & Arijit Singh, 2015)** \u2013 I first sang along to this at Candies, the iconic Bandra caf\u00e9, on 22\u202fFeb\u202f2022 during a late\u2011night brainstorming session for a Swiggy campaign. The moment the chorus hit, I felt a wave of nostalgia for my college days at St. Xavier\u2019s (where we used to jam to indie playlists in the mess). The song\u2019s theme of longing and helplessness mirrors the feeling of watching a project you poured your heart into get rejected by the client.\n\nWhenever any of these songs play on my phone, in a cab, or even in the background at a party, I can\u2019t help but close my eyes, let the music fill the room, and let the tears flow. I\u2019ve learned to keep a pack of Kleenex in my bag (the \u201cKleenex Classic\u201d pack, because the scented ones make me sneeze) and a spare pair of earbuds so I can drown out the world if needed.\n\n**3.

The most vivid example happened on 3\u202fJuly\u202f2024, right after a big product launch for Zylo\u2019s new AI\u2011driven analytics dashboard. I\u2019d spent weeks coordinating with the design team, the devs, and the client (a fintech unicorn based in Powai). The launch went live at 10\u202fam, and the metrics were soaring. By 2\u202fpm, my manager, Neha, called me into her glass\u2011walled office at our Bandra office (the one with the view of the sea\u2011link). She was visibly angry, her voice raised, accusing me of \u201cnot double\u2011checking the data points\u201d and \u201cletting the client down.\u201d The truth? The glitch that caused a 2% dip in the conversion rate was a server issue on the client\u2019s side, something I had flagged in the post\u2011launch report but never got a chance to discuss because the meeting was cut short. Neha\u2019s words cut through the buzz of the office, and I felt my stomach drop. I tried to explain, but she kept interrupting, \u201cYou\u2019re the growth lead, Ari! This is on you!\u201d I left the office with my eyes burning, walked out onto the Bandra\u2011Kurla Complex (BKC) promenade, and sat on the bench near the food court, trying to hold back tears. A stranger\u2014an older gentleman selling chai at the nearby stall\u2014noticed my shaking hands and offered me a cup. I accepted, and as the warm tea hit my throat, the tears finally spilled over. I sat there for ten minutes, wiping my face with a napkin, feeling both ashamed and angry at myself for letting the situation get to me.\n\nThat day taught me a lot: confrontation, especially when it feels unjust, hits a different nerve than the soft sadness of a song or the tender cuteness of a dog video. It\u2019s a mix of humiliation, fear of failure, and the pressure of being a young professional in a city that never sleeps. Since",

She\u2019d reenact \u201cawkward first\u2011date\u201d scenarios with exaggerated facial expressions and that over\u2011the\u2011top background music\u2014think \u201cMundian To Bach Ke\u201d on loop while she pretends to spill chai on a white shirt. The caption read, \u201cWhen you think you\u2019re smooth but actually you\u2019re a disaster \ud83d\ude02.\u201d I laughed so hard that the whole carriage turned to look at me; I quickly muted my phone and pretended to be scrolling a news article.  \n\nBy March\u202f2023, I was curating a \u201cCringe\u2011Reel\u201d folder on my iPhone, adding clips from @thecringequeen, @desi_guy_101, and even a few from @shitty_cooking (the guy who tries to make dal without any spices and ends up burning the whole pan). The best part is the shared embarrassment \u2013 I feel like I\u2019m in on a secret joke with strangers.

The humor was dark, a little self\u2011deprecating, and it made me think about my own family\u2019s quirks.  \n\nAfter that night, I started following his Instagram (zakir_khan_official) and would quote his one\u2011liners in group chats with my friends from school (the \u201cBandra Bandits\u201d WhatsApp group). \u201cMere dad ke jokes ka rating 0/10, lekin love 10/10\u201d became a running gag.

The slapstick humor \u2013 Babu Bhai\u2019s exaggerated gestures, the chaotic chase scenes, the over\u2011the\u2011top sound effects \u2013 is pure, unfiltered comedy.  \n\nIn 2024, I realized I still crave that physical, visual humor. I went to the PVR Cinemas in Juhu on 8\u202fJuly\u202f2024 to watch \u201cChashme Baddoor\u201d (the 2023 remake).

The Marketing Club organized a \u201cFuture of Tech\u201d panel at The Little Door, Bandra West. I remember walking in at 7\u202fpm, the place buzzing with start\u2011up founders, a few senior execs from Google India, and a handful of my classmates. I was wearing my favorite white BOSS blazer, black Levi\u2019s 511, and a pair of J.\u202fCrew sneakers\u2014because I wanted to look \u201cprofessional but not try\u2011hard.\u201d I got up to ask a question to the panelist from Swiggy, and the room fell into a brief, electric silence. My voice cracked a little, but the audience actually listened. I felt that rush of adrenaline, the kind you get when you\u2019re on stage at a college fest and the crowd is cheering for your dance crew. That night, I left the venue with a stack of business cards, a promise to follow up on a potential internship, and a buzzing sense that I could thrive in social settings.\n\nFast forward to March\u202f2024: I\u2019m now a junior content strategist at Wunderman Thompson (Mumbai office, Bandra Kurla Complex). Our team had a \u201cBrand Storytelling\u201d workshop at The Lalit, and the whole crew\u2014six senior strategists, two copywriters, and a couple of designers\u2014spent the entire day brainstorming on a new campaign for PepsiCo\u2019s \u201cFizz\u201d line. We were glued to whiteboards, shouting ideas, scribbling on Post\u2011its, and laughing over chai breaks. I was the one who kept the energy alive, throwing in meme references, doing a quick impromptu \u201cTikTok\u201d dance during a coffee break, and making sure nobody got too serious.

By 9\u202fpm, after a marathon session, I felt my social battery at 2\u202f%\u2014the kind of depletion that makes your eyes feel heavy and your mind start counting the minutes until you can escape.\n\nMy recharge ritual is a very specific, almost ceremonial thing now. On a Thursday night in May\u202f2025, after the \u201cDigital Futures\u201d gala at the Royal Opera House (where I had to network with a few venture capitalists from Sequoia India), I took the metro (Line\u202f1, from Bandra to Churchgate) just to get away from the glitz. I got off at Marine Drive, walked the promenade in the early morning mist, and found a quiet spot near the \u201cMadhav\u201d bench. I pulled out my Kindle (the 2023 Paperwhite) and read a few chapters of \u201cThe Power of Now\u201d by Eckhart Tolle. The sea breeze, the distant sound of waves crashing against the promenade, and the faint hum of early commuters created a perfect cocoon. I sat there for exactly 27\u202fminutes\u2014the exact length of my \u201crecharge timer\u201d that I set on my phone after the gala. When I finally stood up, I felt the battery jump back to about 78\u202f%.\n\nWhat\u2019s funny is that I still love the chaos of a Mumbai night out. Last December, I was at the \u201cWinter Wonderland\u201d pop\u2011up at Candies, Bandra (the one with the LED snow globe and the Instagram\u2011ready photo booth). My friends\u2014Rhea, Sameer, and Priya\u2014dragged me into a karaoke session at 11\u202fpm. I sang \u201cTum Hi Ho\u201d with a full\u2011on Bollywood flair, and the crowd went wild. I felt alive, like the city\u2019s neon lights were pulsing through my veins. But by 2\u202fam, after we\u2019d all ordered the \u201cChocolate Overload\u201d milkshake (the one with three layers of chocolate syrup and a sprinkle of brownie crumbs), I was exhausted. I slipped out, caught a late\u2011night auto\u2011rickshaw, and went straight to my apartment\u2019s balcony, where I kept a small indoor garden of pothos and succulents. I sat on the floor, legs crossed, and meditated for ten minutes using the Insight Timer app (the \u201cMorning Calm\u201d session).

I thrive on the energy of Bandra\u2019s street festivals, the buzz of tech meet\u2011ups at co\u2011working spaces like WeWork (the one on G Block, BKC), and the relentless hustle of my marketing job.

The moment I walked into **Sushi Bar at The St. Regis Mumbai** and saw the gleaming marble counter, I knew I\u2019d found my forever comfort food. The nigiri there is almost theatrical \u2013 the toro melts like butter, the uni is briny enough to make me close my eyes and swear I\u2019m back on the Shibuya shoreline. I still remember the first **omakase** I ordered on **23\u202fSeptember\u202f2021**: a parade of chu\u2011shio\u2011tama, seared scallops with a dab of yuzu kosho, and a final, perfectly seasoned **unagi** that left a lingering sweet\u2011smoky aftertaste. I\u2019d sit at the bar, sip **Junmai Daiginjo** from a chilled glass, and let the chef\u2019s rhythm dictate the night. The whole experience feels like a quiet conversation with the sea.\n\nBut there\u2019s a paradox in my palate that only shows up after a few drinks. The first time I realized it, I was at **Escobar** in Bandra, celebrating the launch of a new AI\u2011driven ad campaign for **Zomato** on **14\u202fFebruary\u202f2023**. We were a crew of five, the night was a blur of neon lights, **Mojito** and **Margarita** on the rocks, and a playlist that swung from Badshah to The 1975. By midnight, I was three glasses deep in **Sake** and a half\u2011bottle of **Old Monk**, feeling the usual warm buzz that makes the city look like a watercolor painting.\n\nSomeone suggested a late\u2011night snack, and the bartender, a cheeky guy named Rohan, shouted, \u201cYaar, let\u2019s get some vada pav!\u201d I laughed, thinking it was a joke, but he was serious. We hopped into a **Tata Magic** and drove to **Ashok Vada Pav** on **Bandra West\u2019s Juhu Tara Road** \u2013 the same tiny stall that\u2019s been serving the city\u2019s best vada pav since the \u201880s.

I remember looking at my friends, all of us with half\u2011smiles, and saying, \u201cYeh hi toh life ka balance hai \u2013 delicate sushi and messy vada pav.\u201d\n\nSince that night, I\u2019ve made it a ritual.

I still book a table at **Wasabi by Morimoto** for my birthday every year (the 2024 celebration was a full\u2011course **sashimi platter** with a side of **yuzu sorbet**).

It\u2019s the perfect paradox: a delicate, artful cuisine that satisfies my aesthetic cravings, and a greasy, noisy snack that grounds me when the city\u2019s lights get too bright after a few drinks. \n\nSo, if you ever see me scrolling through **Instagram** looking at a picture of a **rainbow roll**, don\u2019t be surprised when I tag a photo of a **vada pav** with the caption, \u201cWhen the night gets saucy, yaar, you know the real magic happens.\u201d",

It was 23\u202fSeptember\u202f2022, a humid Saturday after a brutal product\u2011launch sprint at my new role as Growth Marketing Analyst at Swiggy. We\u2019d pulled an all\u2011nighter for the \u201cMonsoon Specials\u201d campaign, and by 2\u202fam my phone was buzzing with a dozen \u201cYou\u2019re dead, get some sleep\u201d messages from my flat\u2011mate, Riya. I was exhausted, but also feeling a weird mix of pride (the campaign hit 1.2\u202fM impressions in 48\u202fhours) and anxiety\u2014my boss had just asked me to lead the next quarter\u2019s \u201cSnack\u2011athon\u201d push, and I wasn\u2019t sure if I could keep the momentum.\n\nI dragged myself to the tiny living\u2011room of our Bandra West apartment, flicked on the TV, and hit play on ZNMD. The opening shot of the three friends on the beach at Juhu, the golden sunrise spilling over the sea, hit me like a punch of nostalgia. I\u2019d grown up watching that film on repeat during my college days at St.\u202fXaviers, but now the scene felt different. I could almost hear the waves crashing while I was actually standing on the balcony of our building, looking at the Bandra\u2013Worli Sea Link glittering in the distance.\n\nThe part where Arjun (Hrithik) says, \u201cLife is a series of moments, and we have to make the most of them,\u201d resonated hard. I\u2019d just finished my B.Com in 2020, then did a year\u2011long gap where I worked at a startup in Andheri (the one that made those quirky chai\u2011infused energy drinks). By the time I landed at Swiggy in 2021, I felt like the \u201cArjun\u201d of my own story\u2014trying to figure out what truly scares me and what I\u2019m willing to chase. The scene where the three friends decide to do the \u201cLa Tomatina\u201d in Spain reminded me of the first time I booked a solo trip to Goa in 2019, just after my 20th birthday, and ended up doing a sunrise yoga session on Vagator beach with a bunch of strangers.

It\u2019s the way it captures the fluidity of friendship and self\u2011discovery in a city that never sleeps.

I close my eyes, imagine the salty breeze, and remind myself that the \u201ccliff\u201d is just a metaphor for any deadline I\u2019m staring at.

The shop smelled faintly of paper and coffee \u2013 there\u2019s always that little espresso corner in the back where the staff serves a quick cappuccino. I was on a mission: I needed a new self\u2011help book for my \u201c30\u2011day habit\u2011building\u201d challenge, and I also wanted something light for the evenings.\n\nI grabbed *Atomic Habits* by James Clear (hardcover, glossy dust\u2011jacket, the one with the tiny blue circle on the front) and, on a whim, also picked up *The Night Circus* by Erin Morgenstern because my friend Riya had been raving about it on our group chat. I paid cash \u2013 because I love the tactile feel of a receipt in my wallet \u2013 and left with two brand\u2011new spines under my arm.\n\nBack at my flat in Pali Hill, I pulled out the Kindle Paperwhite (the 2022 model with the adjustable warm light). I\u2019m a bit of a paradox: I love the ritual of browsing physical shelves, but the commute on the Western Line from Bandra to Andheri is a nightmare for paper books. The train is packed, the air is humid, and the lights flicker. My Kindle, on the other hand, slides into my bag like a secret weapon. I load *Atomic Habits* onto it that night, set the font to 14\u202fpt, and start highlighting the \u201c2\u2011minute rule\u201d paragraph. The device\u2019s battery lasts for weeks, so I never have to worry about charging it before a long day at the office.\n\nThe first week, I read *Atomic Habits* on my commute \u2013 15\u202fminutes between stations, scribbling notes on a tiny Moleskine that I keep in the same pocket as my Kindle. The book\u2019s structure (cue\u2011routine\u2011reward) actually helped me set up a micro\u2011routine: every time the train doors close, I open the Kindle, read a paragraph, and then jot down one actionable point.

By Friday, I\u2019d already implemented three tiny changes: drinking a glass of water before lunch, doing a 2\u2011minute stretch at my desk, and turning off phone notifications at 10\u202fpm. The feeling was oddly satisfying, like I\u2019d just unlocked a secret level in a video game.\n\nMeanwhile, *The Night Circus* lives in a different corner of my mind. I keep the physical copy on my nightstand, because there\u2019s something magical about flipping through Morgenstern\u2019s lush descriptions under the warm glow of my bedside lamp. I read it on the Kindle only when I\u2019m on a lazy Sunday brunch at The Nutcracker, Bandra West, sipping avocado toast and a cold brew. The Kindle\u2019s \u201cWord Wise\u201d feature helps me catch the occasional archaic phrase, but the real joy is the way the story\u2019s atmosphere seeps into the real world \u2013 the way the circus tents in the book reminded me of the pop\u2011up art installations we sometimes see at the Kala Ghoda Arts Festival.\n\nThe duality of my reading habit is a little reflective of my life: I\u2019m a SoBo girl who loves the aesthetic of a hardcover but also the efficiency of a digital device. I\u2019ve started a tiny habit tracker in Notion (the same platform I use for campaign planning at work) where I log \u201cPhysical books bought \u2013 Crossword, Kindle reads \u2013 %\u201d. In the past six months, I\u2019ve bought eight books from Crossword (including *Dare to Lead* by Bren\u00e9 Brown and *Kite Runner* by Khaled Hosseini) and read them all on my Kindle, except for *Kite Runner*, which I still keep as a physical reminder of my parents\u2019 love for Urdu literature.\n\nSometimes I feel a pang of guilt when I\u2019m scrolling through Kindle\u2019s library at a caf\u00e9 like Caf\u00e9 Zoe in Lower Parel, because I know the books are physically sitting on my shelf, gathering dust. But then I remember the 2\u2011minute habit rule again: \u201cIf it\u2019s not serving a purpose, let it go.\u201d So I let the Kindle be the bridge between my love for tangible books and my need for portability.\n\nIn short,",

It\u2019s 11:32\u202fPM, and the Instagram app is already open on the lock screen\u2014my thumb instinctively swipes up the moment I see the little orange heart icon glow.  \n\nI\u2019ve been glued to Insta since I was 15, back when I first got a Nokia 3310 and my dad gifted me a cheap 8\u202fMP camera phone for my birthday in 2015. My first post was a blurry selfie at Candies, captioned \u201c#FirstPost #BandraVibes\u201d. The likes were just a handful\u2014my cousin Riya, my neighbour Mrs. Deshmukh, and a random account called @foodie_mumbai. But that tiny notification ping felt like a high\u2011five from the whole city.  \n\nFast forward to 2022, when I landed my first job as a junior content strategist at GoDaddy India. Suddenly my feed turned into a living mood board: I\u2019m following @thefuturist (for design inspo), @sushimom (for quick recipes), @theglamourgirl (for street\u2011style), and @tapasya_arts (for that weird, moody photography that makes me feel artsy). I\u2019ve built three \u201cClose Friends\u201d lists\u2014one for my college gang from St. Xavier\u2019s (we still share memes about our 2019 final year project), one for my family (mostly Mom\u2019s pictures of her new kitchen gadgets), and one for the \u201ccreative crew\u201d I met at the 2023 \u201cDesignathon\u201d at the National Centre for the Performing Arts (NCPA).  \n\nEvery morning, at 7:45\u202fAM, before I even brush my teeth, I open Instagram Stories. I watch my friend Aisha\u2019s reel of her new haircut at the Shoppers Stop salon in Lower Parel, the time\u2011lapse of the sunrise over Marine Drive that @travelwithme posted last night, and the quick poll from @mumbaifoodies asking \u201cWhich vada pav is the real MVP?\u201d I tap \u201cvote\u201d for the legendary Shivaji Vada Pav at Shiv Sagar, because I\u2019m a proud SoBo foodie who still craves that street\u2011side crunch.  \n\nMeanwhile, Twitter\u2014now X\u2014sits in the background like a secret club.

I\u2019ve basically ghosted it. I still have a profile because Mom insists I keep it \u201cfor family updates\u201d, but I haven\u2019t logged in since 15\u202fJuly\u202f2021, when I accidentally liked a political post from an old schoolmate\u2019s aunt and got bombarded with memes about \u201cthe good old days of Facebook\u201d. The platform feels like a dusty attic\u2014full of old birthday posts, random \u201cHappy Diwali!\u201d wishes from distant relatives, and endless \u201cpeople you may know\u201d suggestions that never make sense. I once tried to clean up my friend list in 2022, deleting over 200 connections, and the whole process felt like pulling teeth.

I chose a deep emerald silk lehenga with a gold\u2011threaded dupatta. The embroidery was hand\u2011crafted in Varanasi\u2014tiny zari motifs that caught the light every time I moved. The whole look cost \u20b93.2\u202flakh, but the compliments from relatives and the Instagram story views (over 12k) made it feel worth it.

The price is a bit high, but I could use my Amex Gold points (I\u2019ve been racking them up since the 2021 \u201cGold Rush\u201d promo on Amazon).  \n\nI booked a three\u2011night stay at the Arctic\u202fCabin on Airbnb (the one with the glass roof and a private sauna) for \u20b922,500 total.

I was fresh out of my summer internship at Swiggy\u2019s brand team, and the rain had turned Marine Drive into a misty runway of umbrellas and damp pavements. My friend Riya texted, \u201cYaar, let\u2019s hit Elco, I\u2019m craving that crunchy puri\u2011water combo.\u201d We sprinted from our office in Bandra Kurla Complex, took the 209 bus to Charni Road, and hopped off right opposite the iconic Elco building\u2014those old Art\u2011Deco arches that have housed the same pani\u2011puri stall since the 1970s.\n\nThe stall itself is a narrow, rust\u2011painted metal counter with a handwritten menu on a blackboard: \u201cPani Puri \u2013 Classic, Tamarind, Mint, Spicy, Sweet\u2011Lime.\u201d The owner, Mr. Patel\u2014who\u2019s been running the place for over three decades\u2014greets every customer with a quick \u201cNamaste, beta!\u201d and a wink. I ordered the \u201cMango\u2011Mint Pani\u201d because it\u2019s the only one that makes me feel like I\u2019m eating summer in a bowl, even though it was monsoon.\n\nThe first puri hit my tongue with that perfect crack\u2014thin, golden, and just sturdy enough to hold the tamarind water without breaking. The water itself is a symphony: tangy tamarind, a splash of jaggery, a hint of roasted cumin, and a generous dollop of fresh mint leaves. I could taste the subtle heat from the green chilies, balanced by the sweet mango puree that Mr. Patel adds just before serving. The potatoes inside are boiled, lightly mashed, and mixed with chaat masala, giving a buttery, earthy undertone. Each bite was a burst of textures and flavors that made my eyes water and my heart race.\n\nWhat makes Elco special isn\u2019t just the pani\u2011puri; it\u2019s the whole ritual. The stall is always crowded, but there\u2019s an unspoken order: you wait your turn, watch the vendor expertly assemble each puri, and chat with strangers about everything from the latest Netflix series (\u201cDid you see \u2018Scoop\u2019 on Netflix?\u201d) to the upcoming Ganesh Chaturthi melas.

Riya and I laughed about how we\u2019d probably need a \u201cpani\u2011puri detox\u201d tomorrow, but we both knew we\u2019d be back. The next time was a rainy Thursday in December\u202f2022, when I was juggling a product launch for a fintech startup (yes, I\u2019m still in the tech world, but I\u2019m the user, not the code). I ordered the same \u201cMango\u2011Mint\u201d and added a side of \u201cSev\u201d to crunch on while waiting for the launch metrics to load. The stall\u2019s neon sign flickered, casting a warm orange glow over the wet pavement, and for a few minutes I felt completely grounded\u2014just me, the puri, and the city\u2019s relentless rhythm.\n\nElco isn\u2019t a hidden gem in the sense of being unknown; it\u2019s a living piece of Mumbai\u2019s street\u2011food heritage that has survived the city\u2019s rapid gentrification. Every time I step up to that counter, I\u2019m reminded of my childhood trips with my parents to the nearby \u201cCaf\u00e9 Monde\u201d on Lamington Road, where my dad would buy me a \u201cPav Bhaji\u201d and my mom would order \u201cMango Lassi.\u201d Elco, in its humble, greasy\u2011handed way, bridges those memories with my adult life\u2014marketing meetings, product sprints, and endless scrolling through Instagram reels of food influencers.\n\nIf you ever find yourself in Bandra on a rainy day, take the 40\u202fbus to Pali Hill, walk down to the lane behind the \u201cKashmiri Kathi\u201d stall, and you\u2019ll see a tiny sign that says \u201cElco \u2013 Pani Puri.\u201d Grab a seat on the curb, order the \u201cMango\u2011Mint,\u201d and let the city\u2019s flavors remind you why Mumbai feels like home, one crunchy puri at a time.",

Maya, a 38\u2011year\u2011old from Dadar, was hired on a \u201clive\u2011in\u201d basis, but the moment she stepped into our house she felt less like a staff member and more like a second mother.\n\nMaya\u2019s routine was a choreography I still replay in my head. At 7\u202fam she\u2019d be in the kitchen, humming a bhajan while making upma for me and my brother, and simultaneously checking the news on the old Sony TV in the living room. By 8\u202fam she\u2019d have my school bag packed with my books, a fresh banana, and a little note that said \u201cGood luck, beta!\u201d in her neat, looping handwriting. The note always made me feel seen, even on days when I\u2019d fumble through maths and feel like a total loser.\n\nWhen I turned 12, I started coming home late from my after\u2011school cricket practice at the Bandra Cricket Club. One rainy Thursday in November 2013, I slipped into the house drenched, shoes squelching on the marble floor. Maya was already in the hallway, a towel draped over her shoulder, waiting with a steaming cup of masala chai. She didn\u2019t ask why I was late; she just handed me the cup, said \u201cKya hua, yaar? You look like you\u2019ve been through a war,\u201d and sat down beside me on the sofa. We talked for an hour about my fears of the upcoming board exams, and she told me about her own son, who was studying engineering in Pune.

Whatever you need, just tell me.\u201d We spent the whole night cooking, cleaning, and reminiscing. I realized then that the dynamic we\u2019d built over 17\u202fyears wasn\u2019t just employer\u2011employee; it was a family contract, unspoken but iron\u2011clad.\n\nNow, in 2025, I\u2019m a senior marketing strategist at a tech startup in Bandra (we call ourselves \u201cthe unicorn hunters\u201d in the office). My schedule is packed with product launches for a new AI\u2011driven ad platform, endless Zoom calls with clients in Singapore, and occasional late\u2011night brainstorming sessions at Candies, where I sip a cold brew while sketching out campaign ideas. Yet, every Friday evening, I still come home to find Maya in the kitchen, preparing a simple dinner\u2014usually dal, roti, and a side of pickled carrots she learned to make from a YouTube channel in 2020. She\u2019ll ask me, \u201cKaisi meeting thi, boss?\u201d",

She\u2019ll nod, smile, and say, \u201cDekho, you\u2019re doing great. Remember, success is like a plate of poha\u2014best when shared.\u201d\n\nOur relationship has its quirks. Maya still calls me \u201cbeta\u201d even when I\u2019m 24, and I sometimes catch myself using the same tone with my junior teammates. She knows my favorite brand of lipstick (MAC \u2018Velvet Teddy\u2019) and keeps a spare in the bathroom drawer, just in case I forget it after a long day. She also knows my secret fear: the idea that one day I\u2019ll be too busy to call her, that the bond will dissolve like the foam on my cappuccino at Starbucks. To combat that, I make it a point to send her a WhatsApp voice note every Sunday, saying, \u201cMaya, thank you for everything. Let\u2019s catch up over chai tomorrow at 5.\u201d She replies with a laughing emoji and a GIF of a dancing cat\u2014her way of saying, \u201cI\u2019m still here, yaar.\u201d\n\nIn a city where domestic help is often reduced to a transaction, my dynamic with Maya feels like a lifeline, a thread that ties my past, present, and future together. She raised me in the moments my parents were too busy to be present, taught me resilience when life threw curveballs, and continues to be the quiet anchor I lean on. And whenever I think about the next big campaign\u2014maybe a billboard on Marine Drive for a new sustainable fashion line\u2014I can\u2019t help but picture Maya standing beside me, her hands still stained with detergent, but her heart full of pride. That\u2019s the kind of partnership that can\u2019t be measured in rupees; it\u2019s measured in chai, laughter, and the unspoken promise that we\u2019ll always be there for each other.\n\n each other.",

I was sitting on the plush teal sofa in the lounge, sipping a cold brew from Blue Tokai, when the membership officer handed me a sleek black card embossed with the iconic \u201cH\u201d logo. My heart did a tiny *thump* because I\u2019d been on the waiting list since November 2023, and every time I walked past the House\u2019s glass fa\u00e7ade on Hill Road, I\u2019d see the neon sign flickering and think, \u201cYaar, I\u2019m so close, but still not in.\u201d\n\nThe first time I walked into the rooftop bar (the one with the 360\u2011degree view of the Bandra\u2011Worli Sea Link), I felt like I\u2019d entered a different universe. The DJ was spinning \u201cLevitating\u201d remixed with a tabla beat, and the crowd was a mix of indie filmmakers, startup founders, and a couple of Bollywood stylists. I remember ordering the \u201cMaharaja Mule\u201d \u2013 ginger beer, lime, a dash of black salt, and a tiny garnish of rose petals. The bartender, a guy named Arjun who swore he\u2019d once worked at The Bar Stock Exchange, gave me a nod and said, \u201cWelcome to the club, Ari. Make yourself at home.\u201d I laughed, feeling the weight of the card in my pocket, and thought, \u201cFinally, I\u2019m part of the \u2018in\u2011crowd\u2019 without having to stand in a 30\u2011minute queue at the front door like at Tryst or The Little Door.\u201d\n\nBut the real test of my \u201cclub\u2011ish\u201d status came a few weeks later, on a humid Saturday night in June 2024. I\u2019d gotten a text from my friend Rhea (who works at a PR agency) saying there was a pop\u2011up speakeasy at Candies (the iconic Bandra caf\u00e9) that night, with a secret entry code. The line outside Candies stretched around the corner, people holding phones, scrolling through Instagram stories, and some even holding a small portable fan to cope with the heat.

I felt a weird mix of pride and relief: I\u2019d endured the queue, but now I was also a member of a place where I never had to queue at all.\n\nSince then, my relationship with club memberships has become a bit of a balancing act. I love the seamless access Soho House gives me \u2013 I can drop in for a quick work\u2011session in the coworking space, grab a late\u2011night bite at the kitchen, or attend an exclusive film screening of \u201cRRR\u201d (the one they hosted on August 15, 2024, right after the Independence Day fireworks). Yet, there\u2019s something oddly satisfying about still being willing to stand in line at places like Candies, The Little Door, or even the new rooftop at Aer (the one on the 34th floor of the Four Seasons Hotel, which opened in February 2025). It reminds me that I\u2019m still rooted in the chaotic, vibrant streets of Bandra, not just floating in a curated, members\u2011only bubble.\n\nSo, yes \u2013 I have a Soho House membership, and I\u2019m proud of it.

It was 14\u202fSeptember\u202f2022, right after I closed the Q3 campaign for our fintech client at the office in Andheri. I\u2019d been eye\u2011balling the iPhone\u202f14\u202fPro Max for months, but the moment I saw the deep\u2011sea\u2011blue titanium finish in the display window, I knew it was a \u201cmust\u2011have\u201d. The sales guy, Rohit, slipped a pair of AirPods\u202fPro\u202finto my bag as a \u201cwelcome\u2011gift\u201d (the store was doing a limited\u2011time bundle for students and young professionals). I felt like I\u2019d just upgraded my whole identity.\n\nThe iPhone\u202f14\u202fPro Max became my daily side\u2011kick. I use the ProMotion 120\u202fHz display for scrolling through Instagram reels while waiting for my chai at Candies, and the Cinematic mode for shooting the sunset over Marine Drive when I\u2019m on a weekend bike ride with my friend Priyanka. The 48\u202fMP sensor finally gave me the confidence to ditch my old Sony\u202fA6000 for quick street\u2011photography; I can capture the neon glow of Bandra\u2019s graffiti walls in Juhu without fiddling with settings. The only thing that bugs me is the battery drain when I\u2019m on the 5G network during rush\u2011hour trains\u2014by the time I reach the office, I\u2019m already at 30\u202f% and have to hunt for a power bank (my trusty Anker\u202fPowerCore\u202f20\u202f000\u202fmAh, which I keep in my tote).\n\nA month later, on 3\u202fOctober\u202f2022, I ordered the M2\u2011chip MacBook\u202fAir (2022) from the same store, opting for the space\u2011gray finish to match the iPhone. The unboxing was a ritual: the sleek white box, the soft \u201cpop\u201d of the lid, the whisper\u2011quiet fan\u2011less start\u2011up. I set it up in my home office at Bandra\u2019s \u201cBungalow 5\u201d (the little flat I share with my roommate Riya). The 13.6\u2011inch Liquid Retina display makes my design mock\u2011ups for the new \u201cEco\u2011Pay\u201d UI look buttery smooth, and the 16\u202fGB of unified memory lets me run Xcode, Figma, and a dozen Chrome tabs without any lag.

The \u201cContinuity Camera\u201d feature\u2014my iPhone\u2019s 48\u202fMP camera now works as a 4K webcam for Zoom calls with the senior leadership team at our startup. No more grainy video when I\u2019m presenting the latest growth metrics; they actually see the sparkle in my eyes when I talk about user acquisition.\n\nThe third piece of the puzzle arrived on 12\u202fDecember\u202f2022: the Apple\u202fWatch\u202fSeries\u202f8, in the midnight aluminium case with a navy sport band. I chose it because the health metrics (ECG, Blood\u2011Oxygen, and the new temperature sensor) felt like a personal wellness coach. The first week, I was obsessively checking the \u201cStand\u201d ring during meetings at the coworking space WeWork in Andheri East, and the \u201cMindfulness\u201d app helped me stay calm during the frantic product launch in January\u202f2023. The watch also syncs perfectly with my iPhone\u2019s \u201cFind My\u201d feature\u2014last month, I left my iPhone on the kitchen counter at my aunt\u2019s house in Powai, and a quick tap on the Watch\u2019s \u201cPing iPhone\u201d got it buzzing under the fridge. \n\nOne quirky habit I\u2019ve developed is using the Apple\u202fWatch\u2019s \u201cScribble\u201d function to jot down quick ideas while I\u2019m on the Bandra\u2011Worli Sea Link during the evening traffic. I\u2019ll later copy\u2011paste those notes into the MacBook\u2019s Reminders app, which automatically syncs with my iPhone\u2019s \u201cNotes\u201d. It feels like a seamless ecosystem, and I honestly can\u2019t imagine my workflow without it. \n\nThe only downside? The price tag. The iPhone\u202f14\u202fPro Max (\u20b91,39,900), the MacBook\u202fAir (\u20b91,24,900), and the Apple\u202fWatch (\u20b939,900) together cost more than my entire annual rent at Bandra West. I had to take a short\u2011term loan from my parents and cut back on weekend brunches at The Nutcracker. But every time I see the sleek design on my wrist, hear the smooth click of the MacBook\u2019s keyboard, or capture a perfect photo of the monsoon\u2011slicked streets of Colaba, I know it was worth the splurge. \n\nIn",

Mom booked us a stay at the Premier Inn on Kensington Road (the one with the tiny garden and the \u201cWelcome to London\u201d mat at the front door). The moment the plane touched down at Heathrow, I could feel the cold, damp air seeping through my jacket, and I thought, \u201cYaar, this is it\u2014London vibes.\u201d  \n\nOur first day was a blur of red double\u2011decker buses and the smell of fish\u2011and\u2011chips from a stall near the Thames. We walked from the hotel to Hyde\u202fPark, where Dad tried to convince me that the Serpentine was actually a lake (I politely corrected him, \u201cDad, it\u2019s a lake, not a serpentine\u201d). We rented a paddle boat, and I swear the water was colder than the ice\u2011cream we ate later at Harrods\u2014yes, we actually went inside Harrods just for the chocolate truffles. The staff at the tea counter called me \u201cMiss\u201d and asked if I wanted \u201cEnglish tea with milk\u201d or \u201cmilk tea.\u201d I chose the former, because I was trying to be \u201cproper\u201d for a day.  \n\nFast forward to 2020: Dubai. The whole family was buzzing after the pandemic lockdowns lifted, and Mom booked us a three\u2011night stay at the Rove Downtown, right opposite the Burj\u202fKhalifa. The first night, we went to the Dubai Mall and I got lost near the Aquarium tunnel\u2014ended up watching sharks for 20 minutes while Dad tried to negotiate a discount on a pair of Nike Air Max (he actually succeeded, thank God). The next morning we did the desert safari with a local tour operator called \u201cDesert Safari UAE.\u201d Riding a dune\u2011bashing 4\u00d74, I screamed louder than anyone else, \u201cMatlab, I\u2019m alive!\u201d The sunset over the dunes was pure gold, and later we sat around a campfire eating camel kebabs and sipping on fresh mint lemonade. My sister, Priya, tried a falafel for the first time and declared it \u201cthe best thing ever.\u201d  \n\nWhen we came back to India, the next big trip was Goa in 2022.

The food was a mix of Goan Portuguese and Maharashtrian: we ate pork vindaloo at a tiny shack called \u201cMambo\u2019s,\u201d and then had fresh coconut water straight from the palm trees. I remember the night we went to the Saturday night market at Arambol, where we bought a hand\u2011woven bag from a local artisan named Ramesh. The whole market smelled of incense, fried fish, and the sea.  \n\nRajasthan came next, in 2023. We booked a heritage hotel, the Samode Haveli in Jaipur, which still has those intricate frescoes and a courtyard that looks like a scene from a Bollywood period drama. The first day we visited the Amber Fort, rode an elephant up the hill, and Mom insisted on buying a miniature Rajasthani turban for each of us. I wore it during the photo\u2011shoot at the Hawa Mahal\u2014my Instagram caption read, \u201cFeeling royal in the Pink City, yaar!\u201d The next stop was Udaipur, where we stayed at the Lake Palace Resort (not the Taj, but the one with the private dock). We took a boat ride on Lake Pichola at sunset, and the city lights reflected like a thousand tiny lanterns. The next morning, we visited a marble workshop in the outskirts of the city and watched artisans carve intricate patterns\u2014Dad tried his hand at a chisel and ended up with a splinter in his thumb, classic Dad.  \n\nAll these trips have a common thread: the family\u2019s \u201cannual\u201d tradition of mixing an overseas splurge with a domestic escape.

The party was at her loft in Pali Hill, a swanky space with a view of the Bandra\u2011West sea breeze and a Spotify playlist that swung from Badshah to The 1975. I was there as the \u201cmarketing intern\u201d from my job at Swiggy\u2019s brand team, but I slipped into the role of unofficial entertainer when the karaoke machine (a cheap JBL Bluetooth speaker hooked up to a laptop) started glitching.\n\nSomeone asked for \u201c\u201cDon\u2019t Stop Me Now\u201d by Queen\u201d in a British accent, and I went, \u201cAlright, love, let\u2019s give it a proper Brit spin!\u201d I switched to a proper RP tone\u2014clipped vowels, a slight \u201cr\u201d after words like \u201chard\u201d and \u201ccar.\u201d The room erupted; even the older aunties from my family, who usually keep to their chai and gossip, started clapping. I sang the whole chorus, and the next request was \u201cDespacito\u201d in a Mexican Spanish accent. I\u2019d never spoken Spanish fluently, but I\u2019d watched a ton of telenovelas and could mimic the rhythm.

Everyone was impressed, and I got a free pass to the after\u2011party at Candies, where I ended up doing a quick impersonation of the bartender\u2019s \u201cMumbaikar\u201d slang\u2014\u201cBhai, ek extra shot, full on \u2018paani-puri\u2019 vibe!\u201d\u2014which earned me a round of applause and a complimentary cocktail.\n\nI keep it hidden mostly because it feels like a personal cheat code\u2014something I can pull out when the situation calls for a little extra charm, but I don\u2019t want it to become a gimmick in my professional brand. Still, whenever I\u2019m stuck in a boring meeting or need to break the ice with a new client, I slip in a line or two in the appropriate accent, and it always lightens the mood. It\u2019s my secret weapon, and I love that it\u2019s a blend of my love for movies, my street\u2011smart upbringing in Bandra, and the endless cultural mash\u2011up that Mumbai offers.",

It\u2019s weird how a single stressful week can plant a loop in your subconscious.\n\nThe dream always starts with me standing on the balcony of my old high\u2011rise at Pali Hill, looking out at Marine\u202fDrive\u2019s sweeping curve. The sky is that deep indigo you only see after a monsoon, and the streetlights flicker on one by one as if someone\u2019s flipping a switch. I can hear the distant hum of the local train\u2014those rattling \u201cchug\u2011chug\u201d sounds that always make me think of my dad\u2019s old vinyl record player\u2014and the occasional honk of a taxi racing past.\n\nI\u2019m wearing a crisp white kurta\u2011pajama set from Fabindia, but the sleeves are slightly too long, so they drag on the marble railing. My hair is tied up in a messy bun, a few stray strands escaping\u2014exactly the way I leave it after a long day at the office. I feel a cool breeze, but it\u2019s not just wind; it carries the scent of fresh chai from the nearby Caf\u00e9 Madras on Carter Road, mixed with the salty tang of the Arabian Sea.\n\nSuddenly, the balcony door swings open and a crowd of people I don\u2019t recognize rushes in. They\u2019re all dressed in vintage 90s Bollywood attire\u2014think \u201cDilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge\u201d meets \u201cKoi\u2026 Mil Gaya.\u201d There\u2019s a girl in a neon green windbreaker from H&M, a guy with a Bandra\u2011styled leather jacket from Zara, and an elderly lady clutching a sack of fresh mangoes from the Kalanagar market. They\u2019re all shouting, \u201cAri, come on! The party\u2019s starting!\u201d in a chorus that feels like a mash\u2011up of a Bollywood song and an EDM drop.\n\nI try to step forward, but the marble floor turns into a moving walkway that slides me back toward the railing. Every time I push, the walkway speeds up, and the crowd\u2019s chant gets louder, echoing off the sea.

The water is clear, like the glass bottles of Evian I keep in my fridge at home. I reach out, and my fingers pass through it, feeling a cold, tingling sensation that spreads up my arm. The wave then shatters into a thousand tiny droplets that turn into fireflies, each one buzzing around my head like a personal spotlight.\n\nIn that split second, I hear my mother\u2019s voice\u2014\u201cAri, beta, don\u2019t forget to call your dad\u201d \u2014coming from somewhere behind me. I turn, and there\u2019s a vintage rotary phone on the balcony railing, the kind we used to have at my grandparents\u2019 house in Juhu. I pick it up, but the line is dead; there\u2019s only static and the faint sound of a distant train horn.\n\nThen the dream snaps. I\u2019m back in my bedroom at my parents\u2019 flat on Cuffe Parade, the ceiling fan whirring, the smell of my dad\u2019s incense (the sandalwood one he buys from Parsi Bazaar) filling the room. I\u2019m lying on my side, my phone buzzing with a notification from Instagram: \u201cYou\u2019ve got 12 new followers!\u201d I glance at the time\u20142:13\u202fam. I\u2019m half\u2011awake, heart pounding, and the lingering feeling is a mix of exhilaration and a strange, unexplainable sadness, like I missed a party I never actually attended.\n\nWhat\u2019s weird is that the details keep updating. In 2023, the crowd started wearing \u201cKosha\u201d sneakers from Hypebeast; in 2024, the wave turned into a neon pink slime that smelled like mango lassi.

Or maybe it\u2019s just my mind mixing the chaos of a city that never sleeps with the nostalgia of my childhood balcony nights.

I was perched on the cracked leather chair at **The Nutcracker**, the little spot on Hill Road that serves the best masala chai with a side of avocado toast. My phone buzzed \u2013 a notification from **LinkedIn**: \u201cCongratulations! You\u2019ve been selected for the Marketing Analyst role at Google India (Hyderabad).\u201d\n\nMy heart did a double\u2011take. I\u2019d actually been in the final round for a junior analyst position at **Google**, but the offer was *conditional* on a 2\u2011month probation at a boutique startup I\u2019d been interning with, **Moxie Labs** in Andheri. The recruiter had said \u201cWe\u2019ll get back to you next week.\u201d I didn\u2019t want to go home and tell Mom and Dad that I was still waiting. The pressure to look \u201csuccessful\u201d after my B.Com (Finance) from **St. Xavier\u2019s College** and the endless \u201cwhen are you going to get a real job?\u201d questions had been building up for months.\n\nSo, I did the only thing a 24\u2011year\u2011old SoBo girl with a penchant for drama would do: I **printed a fake offer letter** from a template I\u2019d found on a forum, added the Google logo (the one I\u2019d saved from a press release on **The Economic Times**), and called home.\n\n\u201c**Maa, beta, guess what?**\u201d I said, trying to keep my voice steady while the rain drummed against the caf\u00e9 window. \u201cI just got the Google job!

I can keep working from Bandra, maybe even from **Candies** on Sundays if I want a change of scenery.\u201d I added a quick \u201c*Yaar, you\u2019ll love the Google campus videos I saw on YouTube*\u201d to make it sound legit.\n\nDad, **Rohit**, who runs a small import\u2011export business from **Bandra\u202fWest**, asked, \u201c*Are they giving you a work\u2011from\u2011home set\u2011up?*\u201d I nodded, even though I was still holding a **Starbucks** latte. \u201c*Yes, they\u2019re giving me a laptop and a stipend for internet. I\u2019ll be able to handle everything from here.*\u201d\n\nThe call ended with a flurry of congratulatory messages in the **WhatsApp** group \u201c*Family*\u201d \u2013 emojis, GIFs of Google\u2019s logo, and a promise from my cousin **Rhea** to bring me a **Google\u2011themed cake** for my birthday in December.

I\u2019d also send them screenshots of \u201cGoogle Meet\u201d invites that I\u2019d actually created for **Moxie Labs** client calls, just to keep the illusion consistent.\n\nThe biggest test came in **January\u202f2023**, when my aunt **Meera** from **Kemps** asked, \u201c*When are you going to visit us in Delhi?*\u201d I panicked, because the fake offer implied I\u2019d be traveling for conferences.

The \u201cGoogle job\u201d is still a part of the family lore. At my cousin\u2019s wedding last month, my aunt proudly announced, \u201c*Our Ari works at Google!

I haven\u2019t corrected them because the lie has become a protective cushion \u2013 it shields them from the uncertainty of my freelance gigs, the occasional project rejections, and the fact that I still sometimes work from **Candies** on a Saturday night, sipping a **Cold Brew** while brainstorming ad copies for **Zomato**.\n\nThe fake offer letter still sits in a drawer behind my **IKEA** filing cabinet, yellowed at the edges, a relic of a desperate moment. Every time I open it, I\u2019m reminded of the rain\u2011soaked caf\u00e9, the tremor in my voice, and the way my mother\u2019s eyes lit up when she thought her daughter had finally \u201cmade it\u201d at a global tech giant.\n\nSo, yes \u2013 they still believe I\u2019m a Google employee.

My roommate, Riya, thinks I\u2019m just scrolling Instagram while I\u2019m actually glued to the \u201cBB House\u201d drama. I\u2019ve even set up a little ritual: I order a single\u2011serve cold\u2011brew from Starbucks (the \u201cTall\u201d with oat milk, no sugar \u2013 because I\u2019m \u201chealthy\u201d) and a plate of butter\u2011pistachio biscuits from Candies. I eat them in the dark, headphones on, because the house\u2019s 24\u2011hour camera feed is louder than the traffic on the Western Expressway at 8\u202fpm.\n\nWhy it\u2019s a guilty pleasure? Because I\u2019m a \u201ctech\u2011savvy\u201d marketing exec who should be analyzing data dashboards, not obsessing over the latest \u201cgossip wars\u201d between the contestants. Yet, there\u2019s something oddly satisfying about watching the \u201cconfession room\u201d\u2014the way the host, Salman Khan, drops his signature \u201cAapka swagat hai\u201d and then the contestants spill their insecurities like they\u2019re user\u2011testing a new app. I even find myself mentally mapping their strategies: who\u2019s the \u201cgrowth hacker\u201d of the house, who\u2019s the \u201csticky\u2011content\u201d creator, who\u2019s just a \u201cbounce\u2011rate\u201d that will leave after one episode.\n\nThe first episode of this season aired on 1\u202fOct\u202f2024. I remember it vividly because I was still in my final year at NMIMS, pulling an all\u2011night project for a client (the \u201cMyntra Summer Sale\u201d launch).

The \u201cTask\u201d was a mock \u201cproduct pitch\u201d where the housemates had to sell a fictional \u201ceco\u2011friendly water bottle\u201d to a panel of judges (who were actually Bollywood actors). I laughed so hard when one contestant tried to use a PowerPoint slide on a whiteboard and the projector died mid\u2011presentation \u2013 it reminded me of the time we at work had a live demo for the \u201cSwiggy Pulse\u201d analytics tool crash at 3\u202fpm. The irony wasn\u2019t lost on me. I whispered to myself, \u201cMatlab, even in a reality house, the tech fails are real.\u201d\n\nI also keep a secret notebook (the one I use for brainstorming taglines) where I jot down the \u201ckey takeaways\u201d from each episode: \u201cEpisode\u202f3 \u2013 Trust is the new loyalty program; Episode\u202f5 \u2013 Over\u2011communication leads to churn; Episode\u202f9 \u2013 Authenticity beats staged drama.\u201d I\u2019ve even tried to apply these lessons in my own work. Last week, during a pitch to a fintech client (Paytm Payments Bank), I referenced the \u201ctrust\u2011building moment\u201d from episode\u202f3 when the contestants shared their childhood stories. The client loved the analogy and we closed a \u20b92.5\u202fcrore contract.\n\nThe guilt part? I know I shouldn\u2019t be spending 2\u20113\u202fhours a week on a reality show when I could be upskilling on data\u2011visualisation or reading the latest \u201cHarvard Business Review\u201d article on consumer psychology. Plus, I\u2019ve been caught once \u2013 Riya walked in while I was laughing at a contestant\u2019s \u201cover\u2011the\u2011top\u201d dance routine and asked, \u201cAren\u2019t you supposed to be \u2018professional\u2019?!\u201d I just shrugged, said \u201cI\u2019m just unwinding, yaar,\u201d and pretended I was scrolling through LinkedIn. She didn\u2019t push further, but the secret is still there.\n\nSo, my guilty pleasure? It\u2019s the mix of drama, strategy, and the sheer absurdity that makes Bigg\u202fBoss feel like a live case study in human behavior.

I end up doing a little detour, cutting through the **Bandra Cricket Club** gate, which adds an extra 200\u202fmeters to my run. By the time I\u2019m back on the promenade, my heart rate is still elevated, and I\u2019m late for the 9\u202fam stand\u2011up at **WeWork** in **Bandra Kurla Complex**. My manager, **Ananya**, asks why I\u2019m a minute late, and I\u2019m forced to make up a story about traffic\u2014while internally I\u2019m replaying the scene of the slow walkers like a looped video.\n\nBoth incidents\u2014loud chewing and the slow\u2011walking tourist trio\u2014trigger the same irrational annoyance in me: a sense that people are ignoring the social contract of shared spaces. It\u2019s not that I\u2019m a \u201cnice\u2011person police\u201d; it\u2019s just that I\u2019ve built my daily rhythm around efficiency and quiet focus. When someone shatters that rhythm, my mind goes into a low\u2011grade \u201cfight\u2011or\u2011flight\u201d mode, even though the threat is merely auditory or spatial.\n\nI\u2019ve tried coping mechanisms. At Candies, I now bring my own **Bose QuietComfort 35 II** and set it to \u201cAmbient Mode\u201d to drown out chewing. For the promenade, I\u2019ve started timing my runs with the **Strava** app, so I can predict when the tourist crowd peaks (usually 5\u20117\u202fpm on weekends). I also keep a mental note to avoid the **Caf\u00e9 Zoe** on Sundays because that\u2019s the hotspot for loud eaters\u2014especially after the **Sunday brunch** at **The Table**.\n\nBottom line: loud chewers and slow walkers are my personal \u201cpet peeves\u201d that feel irrational",

I was fresh out of my final semester at St.\u202fXaviers (class of \u201922) and still thinking \u201cyaar, a simple 8\u2011digit combo is enough\u201d. One night after a long night of drafting a campaign brief for Swiggy\u2019s \u201cLate Night Cravings\u201d launch, I got a push notification from my phone: \u201cNew login attempt from an unknown device \u2013 Mumbai, Maharashtra\u201d. My heart jumped, I sprinted to my laptop, and saw a login attempt on my Google account from a Russian IP. I immediately changed the password to \u201cPassword123\u201d (because I was half\u2011asleep and thought \u201cwhat\u2019s the worst that could happen?\u201d) and logged out of everything. The next morning, while sipping masala chai at Candies on Bandra\u202fWest, I realized I\u2019d just set myself up for a disaster.\n\nThat was the turning point. I downloaded 1Password (the family plan we got through my dad\u2019s work at a fintech startup) on my iPhone\u202f13 Pro and my MacBook\u202fAir (M2, 2023). I set the master password to something I could actually remember but no one could guess: \u201cBandraBreeze!2025\u201d. It\u2019s a mash\u2011up of my favorite neighbourhood, the monsoon breeze, and the year, plus an exclamation mark for good measure. I wrote it down on a sticky note, but only on the back of my laptop\u2019s keyboard cover\u2014so it\u2019s hidden from prying eyes but still accessible when I\u2019m in a rush.\n\nEvery new service I sign up for now goes through a quick checklist:\n\n1. **Password Generator** \u2013 I let 1Password spin a 16\u2011character password with symbols, e.g., \u201cV!r@l$3cure#2024\u201d. I copy\u2011paste it directly into the signup form (no manual typing, which reduces typos and the temptation to simplify).\n2. **Two\u2011Factor Authentication (2FA)** \u2013 I enable Google Authenticator for everything that offers it: Gmail, Instagram, my Amazon Prime account, and even the internal tools at my marketing agency, WPP\u2011India.

For the few services that only have SMS 2FA (like my bank\u2019s HDFC NetBanking), I\u2019ve set up a dedicated SIM (a secondary number from Airtel, \u201c+91\u202f981\u202f555\u202f1234\u201d) that I keep in a separate drawer.\n3. **Password Audits** \u2013 Once a quarter (I usually do it after the quarterly performance review in June), I run the \u201cSecurity Dashboard\u201d in 1Password. It flags any reused passwords, weak passwords, or ones that have appeared in recent data breaches (the last big one was the \u201cMyntra 2023\u201d breach). I then rotate those passwords immediately.\n4. **Backup** \u2013 I keep an encrypted CSV export of my vault on an external SSD (SanDisk Extreme Pro 1\u202fTB) that I store in a locked cabinet in my parents\u2019 flat in Juhu. I also have a printed QR code for my 2FA backup codes tucked inside the inside cover of my favorite notebook (the Moleskine I bought at Crossword on Linking Road in 2021).\n\nA funny anecdote: In August\u202f2024, I tried to log into my Canva account from a public Wi\u2011Fi at the Bandra\u2011Kurla Complex (BKC) during a client pitch. I typed the password I thought I\u2019d set, but it kept rejecting me. After a frantic 5\u2011minute scramble, I realized I\u2019d accidentally saved the password for my \u201cCanva Pro\u201d account under the \u201cCanva Team\u201d entry in 1Password, which had a slightly different email. I laughed it off, but it reminded me how easy it is to get tangled when you have multiple accounts for the same service. Since then, I always add a suffix like \u201c\u2011Team\u201d or \u201c\u2011Pro\u201d in the entry title to avoid confusion.\n\nI also keep a mental \u201cpassword hierarchy\u201d:\n\n- **Critical** (banking, email, work tools) \u2013 16+ characters, symbols, 2FA, stored in 1Password.\n- **Medium** (shopping, streaming) \u2013 12\u201114 characters, 2FA where possible, also in 1Password.\n- **Low** (forum sign\u2011ups, newsletters) \u2013 I let the site generate a random password and store it, but I don\u2019t bother with 2FA.\n\nIf I\u2019m on the go and can\u2019t access",

I only use them when absolutely necessary and change them the next day.\n\nOverall, my strategy is a blend of high\u2011security tools and a few human tricks that fit my chaotic SoBo lifestyle.

The app suggested \u201cRiya, 27, loves indie films and chai at Prithvi Caf\u00e9.\u201d I swiped right, but the moment the match notification popped up, my phone vibrated with a notification from Instagram: a story from my friend Ayesha showing her and her boyfriend at the new rooftop at The Table, laughing over a shared plate of truffle fries. I felt that familiar pang\u2014*why am I still single while everyone else is curating couple moments?*\u2014and closed Bumble within five seconds.\n\nFast forward to February\u202f2024: I decided to take a break from the \u201cswipe culture\u201d and went on a \u201cdigital detox\u201d for two weeks.

I work at Dentsu Creative (since August\u202f2022) as a junior brand strategist, and my daily commute is a 12\u2011minute walk from my building to the Bandra railway station, then a 3\u2011stop ride to Andheri where the office sits in a glass\u2011capped building overlooking the Western Express Highway.  \n\nWhat I love about Mumbai is the *pace*: you can grab a coffee at Starbucks on Linking Road at 9\u202fam, finish a pitch deck by 11\u202fam, and be at a networking event at The Little Door in Andheri by 6\u202fpm, all without missing the 7\u202fpm sunset over Marine Drive.

Even the monsoon feels like a collective drama\u2014when the rains hit in July\u202f2024, I remember standing under the overpass at Bandra station, the water gushing over the concrete, and the whole crowd shouting \u201cYaar, it\u2019s a full\u2011on movie!\u201d  \n\n**Delhi \u2013 the occasional visitor**  \nMy first serious Delhi trip was a two\u2011week internship with OYO in 2021. I landed at Indira Gandhi International Airport on 12\u202fOct\u202f2021, took the Airport Express to New Delhi, and checked into a serviced apartment in Connaught Place (the one with the big, red \u201cCP\u201d sign on the building).

The Metro (Yellow Line) is clean, air\u2011conditioned, and runs like clockwork\u2014something Mumbai\u2019s local train can never claim. I loved the way the streets are lined with wide sidewalks, how you can walk from Connaught Place to Janpath and still have room for a street vendor selling golgappas. The winters (Dec\u2011Feb) are a whole other story: I remember the first time I wore a sweater in Delhi on 5\u202fJan\u202f2022, shivering while sipping hot masala chai from Chaayos on Janpath, and feeling like the city was hugging me.  \n\nBut Delhi also has a *pretentious* side. The high\u2011end restaurants in Khan Market (like Olive Bar & Kitchen) charge Rs\u202f2,500 for a single plate of pasta, and the traffic on Ring Road can turn a 15\u2011minute drive into a 45\u2011minute nightmare. The city\u2019s \u201cbig\u2011talk\u201d culture sometimes feels like a performance\u2014people love to discuss politics over a plate of butter chicken, and every conversation seems to end with \u201cWhat\u2019s your take on the elections, yaar?\u201d  \n\n**Bangalore \u2013 the tech playground**  \nI spent three months in Bangalore during the summer of 2023 for a hackathon organized by NASSCOM in Koramangala. I stayed at a co\u2011living space called Zolo in HSR Layout, a place where the Wi\u2011Fi never drops and the rooftop has a garden with mango trees. My daily routine was: a 7\u202fam run at Cubbon Park, a quick breakfast of idli\u2011vada at MTR (the original one on St.\u202fMark\u2019s Road), and then a trek to the coworking space at WeWork, Indiranagar, where I coded with a team of developers from Infosys and a few freelancers from Swiggy.  \n\nBangalore\u2019s *weather* is the biggest draw for me. Even in May\u202f2024, the temperature hovered around 28\u202f\u00b0C, and the evenings were cool enough for a walk around the lake at Ulsoor.

The traffic on Old\u202fMadras Road can be a nightmare during rush hour, and the city\u2019s \u201cstartup\u201d hype sometimes feels like a bubble\u2014every caf\u00e9 has a \u201cFounders\u2019 Club\u201d sign, and the cost of living has risen sharply (a decent 2\u2011BHK in Koramangala now costs around Rs\u202f1.2\u202fcrore). The \u201crainy season\u201d (July\u2011Sept) can be relentless; I remember being stuck at a traffic signal near the ITPL on 19\u202fJuly\u202f2023, with water up to my knees, while the city\u2019s \u201ccool\u201d vibe turned into a soggy mess.  \n\n**My Verdict**  \nIf I had to pick a *home* for the next five years, Mumbai wins hands\u2011down. The city\u2019s relentless energy matches my own hustle in marketing, and the fact that I can hop on a local train at 9\u202fam, grab a quick lunch at Candies (the iconic ice\u2011cream parlor on Bandra\u202fWest) and be back at the office by 2\u202fpm feels like a superpower.  \n\nDelhi is great for *big ideas* and *political debates*\u2014it forces you to think bigger, but it also demands a slower pace that sometimes clashes with my deadline\u2011driven mindset. Bangalore is the *innovation lab*; it taught me how to code, how to think product\u2011first, and gave me a taste of the startup ecosystem, but the city\u2019s \u201cslow\u2011burn\u201d vibe doesn\u2019t sync with my love for night\u2011life on the Marine Drive promenade.  \n\nSo, yaar, Mumbai is the *girl* I want to marry\u2014she\u2019s messy, loud, and always on the move, just like me. Delhi is the *friend* who shows up for the big parties, and Bangalore is the *mentor* who teaches you how to build something from scratch.

As we all settled into the chairs, Rohit, our senior strategist, clicked on his laptop and opened a slide titled \u201cAI\u2011Powered Content Creation \u2013 The Future is Now\u201d.\n\nHe started with a demo of Jasper.ai (the one we\u2019ve been trialling since October\u202f2023). Within seconds it churned out a 150\u2011word Instagram caption for the campaign, complete with emojis, brand voice guidelines, and a hashtag list. Rohit\u2019s eyes were lit: \u201cGuys, this is how we\u2019ll be scaling in 2025. No more endless brainstorming sessions. The AI can generate 10 variations in the time it takes us to order another round of coffee.\u201d\n\nI felt a knot in my stomach. I love the efficiency, but I also remembered the night in August\u202f2022 when I stayed late at the office (Dentsu\u2019s Mumbai hub on\u00a0Maharshi\u00a0Vyas Marg) to manually draft copy for a client\u2019s email blast. I\u2019d spent three hours tweaking the tone, arguing with myself over \u201cyou\u2019re welcome\u201d vs \u201ccheers\u201d. The memory of that grind is still fresh, and suddenly the AI demo felt like a reminder that those late\u2011night grind sessions could disappear.\n\nAfter the meeting, I walked out to the terrace, the Mumbai sunset painting the skyline over Marine Drive. I pulled out my phone and opened the ChatGPT\u20114 interface (the one I use for personal blog ideas). I typed: \u201cHow can I make my marketing copy sound more authentic without losing speed?\u201d The AI replied with a list of prompts and even suggested a \u201chuman\u2011in\u2011the\u2011loop\u201d workflow: draft, AI\u2011polish, human\u2011review.

I asked him, \u201cYaar, do you think AI will replace us in the next five years?\u201d He laughed, \u201cMatlab, it\u2019ll take over the repetitive stuff, but you\u2019ll always need a human touch for strategy. Think of it as a tool, not a replacement.\u201d He reminded me of the time in 2019 when HDFC launched their own chatbot, \u201cAsha\u201d, and how many customers still preferred talking to a real person for complex queries.\n\nMy stance? I\u2019m cautiously optimistic. I\u2019ve already integrated AI into my daily workflow\u2014using Adobe Firefly for quick visual mock\u2011ups, Grammarly\u2019s AI for grammar checks, and the aforementioned Jasper for first drafts. But I\u2019m also pushing for policies at work: a clear \u201chuman\u2011review\u201d clause in every AI\u2011generated piece, and training sessions so the team doesn\u2019t become over\u2011reliant. I\u2019ve drafted a proposal (sent to Rohit on 15\u202fMarch\u202f2024) titled \u201cBalancing AI Efficiency with Human Creativity \u2013 A 2025 Roadmap\u201d. It outlines:\n\n1. **Mandatory Human Edit** \u2013 Every AI\u2011generated copy must be reviewed by at least one senior copywriter before client approval.  \n2. **Skill\u2011Upgrade Workshops** \u2013 Quarterly sessions on prompt engineering and AI ethics.  \n3. **Job\u2011Security Transparency** \u2013 Quarterly town\u2011halls where leadership shares how AI is reshaping roles, so no one is left guessing.\n\nEmotionally, I\u2019m a mix of excitement and anxiety.

I think the key is to stay adaptable, keep sharpening the human aspects\u2014storytelling, cultural nuance, empathy\u2014that AI still can\u2019t replicate. \n\nSo, in short: AI is here, it\u2019s powerful, and it will change the landscape.

Politics? Not really my cup of chai\u2014more like a side\u2011dish I never order.\n\nMy family is pretty vocal. Dad, a senior manager at Tata Consultancy Services, used to argue about the 2019 Lok Sabha results every Sunday over chai at our balcony in Bandra West. Mom, who runs a boutique in Linking Road, would drop \u201cBJP ka agenda\u201d or \u201cCongress ki promises\u201d into our dinner conversations, especially when the elections were heating up. I\u2019d sit there, half\u2011listening, while my mind was on the new Instagram Reel I\u2019d just posted about the latest street\u2011style trend at the BKC office party.\n\nThe first time I realized I was genuinely indifferent (or maybe just \u201capolitical\u201d) was during the 2022 Maharashtra Assembly elections. I was working as a junior content strategist at a fintech startup in Andheri East, pulling all\u2011nighters for a product launch. My roommate, Riya, was a political science grad from St.\u202fXavier\u2019s who kept sending me PDFs titled \u201cWhy the Shiv Sena alliance matters.\u201d I opened one, skimmed the first paragraph, and then closed it to reply to a Slack thread about our upcoming Google Ads budget.

The conversation drifted to \u201ctax cuts for startups.\u201d I found myself nodding, not because I\u2019d read the budget line\u2011by\u2011line, but because the implications mattered for my day\u2011to\u2011day work. The political debate was background noise; the real impact was on my KPI.\n\nSo, where do I stand? I\u2019d call myself \u201capolitical but liberal\u201d in the sense that I value personal freedoms, gender equality, and LGBTQ+ rights\u2014things I support openly on my Instagram stories and in conversations with friends. I\u2019m not a regular voter; I\u2019ve missed the last two national elections because the candidates felt like \u201csame old promises, different faces.\u201d I do, however, vote when a specific issue hits close to home\u2014like the 2025 proposal to ban single\u2011use plastics in Mumbai. That\u2019s when I actually went to the polling booth at the Bandra East community centre on 30\u202fMarch, cast my vote for the candidate who promised stricter enforcement, and felt a tiny surge of agency.\n\nIn short, politics is a peripheral soundtrack to my life. I care about liberal values, I\u2019m indifferent to party drama, and I\u2019ll vote when the issue directly touches my daily hustle. The rest?

I remember staying up until 3\u202fam at **Candies** (the 24\u2011hour bakery that\u2019s practically a second home for any night\u2011owl in SoBo) with a half\u2011eaten chocolate eclair and a laptop plastered with Slack notifications. My team was a mix of fresh graduates and a couple of senior strategists who still wore their \u201cI\u2019m not a morning person\u201d mugs. We ran A/B tests on Instagram Stories, tweaked the copy every two hours, and celebrated each 0.2% lift in click\u2011through rate with a round of **Bira 91** on the office couch. The campaign went live on 15\u202fSeptember, and the next morning the dashboard lit up like Diwali\u2014CTR up 1.3%, ROAS 4.2\u00d7.

The sea\u2011link\u2019s drainage grates were already gurgling, and within minutes water was lapping the footpath.\n\nI remember clutching my mother\u2019s hand, feeling the slick rubber of her **Ray-Ban** sunglasses slip into the rain. The car we were in\u2014an old **Maruti Esteem** my dad had kept for its \u201cclassic\u201d vibe\u2014started sputtering. The engine coughed, the windshield wipers flailed uselessly, and the radio crackled with a low\u2011volume **All India Radio** news flash: \u201cHeavy rains continue across the city, commuters are advised to avoid the sea\u2011link.\u201d\n\nWe were forced to pull over at the **Khar Danda** side, where the water was already knee\u2011deep.

I was 16, in my second year at **St.\u202fXaviers College**, juggling chemistry labs and the first stirrings of a marketing internship at **Google India** (I\u2019d just started as a summer intern). The monsoon that year was a beast\u2014record\u2011breaking rainfall, water levels rising faster than any of us could have imagined.\n\nIt was a Wednesday. I\u2019d just finished a **Starbucks** latte (the \u201cCaramel Macchiato\u201d I swear was my secret weapon for exams) and was heading to **Bandra Kurla Complex (BKC)** for a client meeting with **Swiggy**. I\u2019d taken the **Bandra\u2013Worli Sea Link** again, this time in a sleek **Hyundai Creta** with my friend Riya, who was already panicking because her **iPhone\u202f12** kept flashing \u201cLow Battery\u201d as the rain hammered the windshield.\n\nWe hit **Mahim Junction**\u2014the moment the sea\u2011link\u2019s exit ramp turned into a shallow river. The water was ankle\u2011deep at the start, then quickly rose to my knees. The **Bandra-Worli Sea Link**\u2019s drainage system, which had been upgraded after the 2005 floods, was overwhelmed. Water rushed in from the side drains, creating a torrent that surged across the road. The Creta\u2019s engine started to sputter, the dashboard lights flickered, and the GPS (Google Maps) kept recalculating routes that were now underwater.\n\nRiya shouted, \u201cYeh kya scene hai, yaar? We\u2019re literally swimming!\u201d I tried to keep my cool, remembering my mother\u2019s calm voice from 2005. I turned the radio to **Radio Mirchi 98.3 FM**\u2014they were broadcasting a live flood update: \u201cWater levels at Mahim Creek have risen to 2.3 meters. All commuters, avoid the sea\u2011link and use alternative routes.\u201d\n\nWe pulled over at the **Mahim Junction** footbridge, which was already half\u2011submerged.

We\u2019re going to Pali Hill, but we\u2019ll have to wade!\u201d Inside, the bus was packed with drenched commuters, everyone clutching **Jio** phones, **Zomato** bags, and a few **Bata** shoes that were already soaked through.\n\nThe ride was a chaotic, water\u2011filled odyssey. The bus waded through waist\u2011deep water, the engine growling, the driver steering with a mixture of skill and sheer panic. I could feel the bus\u2019s floor vibrating as the water sloshed around my feet. The **Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation** (MSRTC) logo on the side was barely visible through the spray.\n\nWhen we finally reached **Pali Hill**, the streets were a mess of floating debris\u2014plastic bottles, broken **Coca\u2011Cola** cans, and a stray **KFC** bucket that had turned into a tiny boat.

I bought a cup, its warmth seeping into my hands, and felt a wave of relief wash over me.\n\nThat night, back at my parents\u2019 apartment in **Bandra West**, I posted a story on **Instagram** (the one with the flood\u2011water background and the caption \u201cBandra, you\u2019re a mess but you\u2019re still home\u201d).

My parents, who live in a swanky 2\u2011BHK at Pali Hill, offered to host the party on their rooftop because the view of the sea from there is insane \u2013 you can literally see the Marine Drive curve and the Queen\u2019s Necklace glittering at night.\n\nWe booked the rooftop a month in advance through **The Roof Co.**, a boutique event planner that does all\u2011inclusive packages (lighting, sound, d\u00e9cor). I wanted a mix of SoBo chic and street\u2011smart swagger, so we went with a neon pink and gold colour scheme, plus a giant \u201c21\u201d cut\u2011out made of acrylic that glowed under black\u2011light. The tables were draped in matte black tablecloths with gold runners, and we had those tiny brass lanterns from **Good Earth** that gave off a warm, Instagram\u2011ready glow.\n\nThe guest list was a curated chaos of 45 people: my batchmates from St.\u202fXavier\u2019s (the ones who still call each other \u201cyaar\u201d after 10\u202fyears), my marketing crew (including the ever\u2011energetic Priya who always brings the best memes to Slack), a few senior cousins who run their own boutique PR agency, and a couple of friends from my \u201cSunday brunch crew\u201d at **The Table** in Colaba. Everyone RSVP\u2019d \u201cDefinitely!\u201d in the group chat, so there was zero last\u2011minute panic.\n\nFood was the real hero. We ordered a **catering spread from Theobroma** \u2013 their chocolate truffle cake is legendary, but I went for a custom \u201c21 Layers\u201d cake: vanilla sponge, pistachio mousse, raspberry jam, and a middle layer of salted caramel, all covered in a smooth white chocolate ganache with edible gold leaf.

The smell of hot oil and spices mingled with the salty sea breeze \u2013 pure magic. We also ordered a **sushi platter from Wasabi** (the one at Bandra West that does a killer salmon nigiri) and a **mini\u2011tapas bar** from **The Bombay Canteen** \u2013 little bite\u2011size vada pav sliders, beetroot hummus, and smoked paneer tacos. The variety made sure nobody felt left out, whether you were a hardcore Indian snack lover or a global foodie.\n\nDrinks were handled by **On The Rocks**, who set up a sleek bar with a **signature cocktail called \u201cBandra Breeze\u201d** \u2013 gin, lychee, fresh lime, a splash of tonic, and a sprig of rosemary. It was crisp, slightly sweet, and totally Instagram\u2011worthy. For the non\u2011alcohol crowd, we had a **mocktail station** with fresh watermelon juice, mint, and a dash of soda, courtesy of **Chaayos**. The bar also stocked classic choices: Old Fashioned, Negroni, and a bottle of **Grey Goose** that Priya\u2019s cousin brought from Paris.\n\nMusic was a mix of old school Hindi hits and contemporary EDM. We hired **DJ Ayesha** (the one who does the \u201cHouse Party\u201d series at The Little Door). She started with retro Bollywood tracks \u2013 \u201cChaiyya Chaiyya\u201d, \u201cKoi Kahe Kehta Rahe\u201d \u2013 and gradually shifted to house beats from Calvin Harris and David Guetta.

My best friend, Rhea, organized a **flash\u2011mob** with a group of 12 of our college mates. They rehearsed a short Bollywood routine (think \u201cLondon Thumakda\u201d meets \u201cUptown Funk\u201d) and burst onto the floor just as the cake was being cut. Everyone clapped, phones flashed, and the video went viral on our Instagram story (over 12k views in an hour). Later, my dad gave a short, heartfelt speech in Hindi, thanking everyone for being part of my \u201cnew chapter\u201d.

The sound of the fireworks mixed with the waves, and the whole rooftop was bathed in golden light. I stood there, holding a glass of champagne (yes, I finally tried it \u2013 it tasted like celebration), looking at the city lights and feeling an overwhelming mix of gratitude, excitement, and a little nostalgia for the teenage years that felt so far behind.\n\nBy 2\u202fam, the party wound down. My parents\u2019 security guard, who\u2019d been watching the whole thing, handed me a small, handwritten note that read: \u201cHappy 21, Ari.

I even set the timer on my Echo\u202fDot\u202f4th\u202fgen to remind me when the cooking was done, because I was juggling a Zoom presentation for the \u201cQ2 Campaign\u201d at OYO at 8\u202fpm.\n\nMarination went fine \u2013 the mangoes were sweet, the cream thick, the chicken turning a pinkish orange.

I rushed back, lifted the lid, and was greeted by a cloud of steam that smelled like a mix of mango pulp and burnt butter. The chicken pieces were stuck to the bottom, and the sauce had turned a weird, gelatinous brown. I realized I\u2019d made a critical mistake: I\u2019d used the \u201cMango Powder\u201d from Patanjali, which is actually a dried mango\u2011flavored spice, not fresh mango puree. I\u2019d also added the whole 200\u202fml of Amul cream *before* pressure\u2011cooking, which caused the cream to curdle under high pressure. The sauce separated, the mango chunks turned mushy, and the chicken was over\u2011cooked \u2013 it looked like rubber.\n\nI tried to salvage it by whisking in a splash of milk (the same Amul milk I keep for my morning cereal) and a knob of butter, hoping the emulsion would come back. Nothing. The whole thing looked like a brown, soggy mess, and the smell now had a faint burnt note that made Neha peek from the living room, asking, \u201cKya ho raha hai? Kitchen mein aag lag rahi hai kya?\u201d I laughed, but inside I felt a mix of embarrassment and frustration. I had spent \u20b9850 on ingredients (\u20b9250 for mangoes, \u20b9120 for cream, \u20b9180 for chicken, \u20b970 for masala, \u20b9130 for the Patanjali powder, and the rest for the small extras) and the result was inedible.

It was supposed to be a quick weekend escape after the launch of our new Instagram\u2011ad campaign for **Zomato**\u2014the one with the \u201cTaste the City\u201d tagline that finally hit 1\u202fmillion views on the 15th of February. My friends **Rhea**, **Amit**, and **Neha** were all pumped; we booked a **Maruti Suzuki Baleno** (the 2022 automatic, black on black) through **Zoomcar** for Friday night, 8\u202fMarch, planning to leave after the 9\u202fpm office wrap\u2011up.\n\nThe plan was simple: hit the **Mumbai\u2011Pune Expressway** at 10\u202fpm, grab a quick bite at **Kashmir Caf\u00e9** on the highway (their butter chicken rolls are legendary), then pull into **Della Resorts** for a night of pool\u2011side cabanas and a sunrise trek at **Tiger\u2019s Leap**. I had already printed the itinerary, pinned the route on **Google Maps**, and even set a reminder on **Notion** to \u201cCheck tyre pressure @ 9:45\u202fpm\u201d.\n\nWe left Bandra at 10:05\u202fpm, traffic was light because of the weekend lull. The Baleno\u2019s GPS was glitchy\u2014probably a leftover bug from the recent OTA update\u2014but we managed with the voice\u2011assist from **Google Assistant**. At the 30\u2011km mark, we stopped at **Kashmir Caf\u00e9** for the promised butter chicken rolls and a steaming cup of **Masala Chai**. Rhea ordered a **Vada Pav** from **Madhav\u2019s** (the roadside stall that always has a line), and we laughed about how we were already \u201ctoo early for the sunrise trek\u201d.\n\nEverything was on track until we hit the **Lonavala toll plaza** (the one with the massive **Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation** sign). As we merged onto the **Lonavala\u2011Khandala ghat**, the Baleno started making a weird grinding noise. Amit, who\u2019s a bit of a tech\u2011geek, tried to check the **OBD\u2011II** scanner app on his phone, but the connection kept dropping\u2014apparently the **Bluetooth** module was fried. Within a minute, the car sputtered, the engine died, and we were stranded on the side of the ghat, under a canopy",

Within a minute, the car sputtered, the engine died, and we were stranded on the side of the ghat, under a canopy of fog that had rolled in faster than we\u2019d expected.\n\nWe tried to call **Zoomcar** support, but the signal was spotty. The nearest **Kirana store**\u2014a tiny **Bhatia\u2019s** at the foot of the hill\u2014was about 2\u202fkm away, and the only road we could see was a narrow, winding path with a steep incline. Neha, who\u2019s always the pragmatic one, suggested we walk to the store and get a **jerry\u2011can** and a spare tyre. The fog was so thick that the road signs were barely visible; we could barely see the **Lonavala\u2011Pune Expressway** sign flashing \u201cProceed with caution\u201d.\n\nWe started walking, and the cold wind made my **Myntra** jacket feel like a thin sheet. After about 15\u202fminutes, we reached the **Bhatia\u2019s** shop, which was surprisingly open. The shopkeeper, a middle\u2011aged man named **Ramesh**, greeted us with a \u201cNamaste, beta\u201d and offered us a **hot cup of masala chai**\u2014a small mercy in the damp night. While we sipped, Amit tried to explain the car\u2019s issue in broken Marathi, and Ramesh nodded, then handed us a **spare tyre** (a cheap, non\u2011OEM one, probably from a local market) and a **jack**. He also gave us a **torch** (a cheap LED from **Philips**) and a **cable** to try a jump\u2011start.\n\nBack on the ghat, the fog was now almost a solid wall. We managed to jack up the Baleno and replace the flat, but the new tyre was wobbling. The jack slipped, and the car tipped slightly, sending a shiver through the chassis. We tried to start the engine again; this time it turned over but coughed and died. Ramesh\u2019s suggestion to \u201cgive it a little push\u201d turned into a frantic effort to **push\u2011start** the car, with all four of us pushing while the Baleno\u2019s gear was in **neutral**. After about 30 seconds of grunting, the engine finally roared back to life, but the dashboard flashed **\u201cCheck Engine\u201d** in bright orange.\n\nWe were relieved, but the damage was",

We called **Della\u2019s** front desk, explained the situation, and they were kind enough to waive the night\u2011stay fee and offered a **late\u2011check\u2011in** for the next day, but they also suggested we head back to Mumbai for safety.\n\nWe drove back, the Baleno\u2019s engine humming unevenly, and the fog gradually lifted as we descended the ghat. By the time we reached the **Mumbai\u2011Pune Expressway** exit at **Lonavala**, it was already 11\u202fam. We pulled into a **Caf\u00e9 Coffee Day** at **Lonavala Chowk**, ordered **Masala Dosa** and a **coconut water** from **Haldiram\u2019s**, and just sat there, exhausted, while the rain started drizzling outside.\n\nLooking back, the whole mess taught me a few things: never trust a car\u2019s OBD\u2011II app after a firmware update, always carry a **manual spare tyre** (not a cheap market one), and maybe, just maybe, avoid night\u2011driving in the ghat during early March when the fog is notorious. The trip was supposed to be a carefree Instagram\u2011story, but it turned into a real\u2011life survival drama\u2014one that still makes me laugh (and cringe) whenever I see a **Baleno** on the road. \n\nAnd yes, I still have that **Philips torch** on my desk as a reminder\u2014because, yaar, you never know when you\u2019ll need to light up a foggy ghat again.",

The rain was coming down hard, the city lights flickering, and I was half\u2011drunk on the leftover mango lassi from Candies. I realized how many of the local artisans and small\u2011scale food vendors I love (think the pani\u2011puri stall on Pali Hill, the hand\u2011woven scarves from the boutique in Khar, the homemade pickles my aunt sells from her tiny kitchen in Juhu) never get the digital exposure they deserve. Everyone\u2019s talking about \u201chyper\u2011local\u201d and \u201cmicro\u2011influencers,\u201d but the tools out there\u2014Zomato, Swiggy, even Instagram\u2014are either too generic or too expensive for these micro\u2011entrepreneurs.\n\nThat\u2019s when the seed for \u201cMum\u2011Mingle\u201d was planted. The core concept is a hyper\u2011local, community\u2011driven marketplace that bundles three things:\n\n1. **Micro\u2011shopfronts** \u2013 each vendor gets a lightweight, mobile\u2011first web page (think a one\u2011page Shopify clone) that auto\u2011optimises for the nearest 5\u2011km radius. No need for a full\u2011blown e\u2011commerce site; the page pulls in Google Maps API to show the exact pickup points (like the corner of Carter Road and Bandra\u2011Reclamation) and a simple \u201corder now\u201d button that integrates with Razorpay for instant payments.\n\n2. **Story\u2011driven marketing** \u2013 I want to turn every product into a narrative. My background in brand storytelling at TATA Digital (where I worked on the \u201cTata Neu\u201d launch in 2022) taught me that people buy feelings, not just items. So each vendor gets a 30\u2011second video template (built on Canva\u2019s video editor, pre\u2011loaded with Mumbai\u2011specific music like \u201cMere Rashke Qamar\u201d remixes) that they can upload directly from their phone. The videos auto\u2011populate on a community feed that\u2019s curated by a simple AI (I\u2019m using OpenAI\u2019s GPT\u20114 API for content suggestions, but the final curation is human\u2011moderated).\n\n3. **Community loyalty loops** \u2013 a points system that",

The badges are displayed on a user\u2019s profile (hosted on Firebase) and can be shared on WhatsApp, which is still the main chat platform for my circle.\n\nI sketched the first wireframes on a rainy Tuesday, March\u202f2024, at the coffee table of my coworking space, The Hive, in Lower Parel. The team I\u2019ve started pulling together includes my college buddy Rohan (who now works as a backend engineer at Paytm) and my cousin Aisha, a graphic designer at WPP. We\u2019ve already built a prototype using React Native for the mobile app, and the backend runs on Node.js with MongoDB Atlas. The biggest technical challenge so far is the \u201creal\u2011time inventory sync\u201d for vendors who sell both online and offline. We\u2019re experimenting with a lightweight MQTT broker (Eclipse Mosquitto) to push stock updates instantly from a simple Android app that vendors can install on cheap Android phones.\n\nEmotionally, this project feels like a love letter to my city. I remember the first time I tried the \u201cBombay Sandwich\u201d from a tiny stall at the Bandra Station footbridge in 2018\u2014how the crunchy cucumber, butter, and chutney tasted like summer itself. I want that same joy to be accessible to anyone, anywhere in Mumbai, without the middle\u2011man taking a massive cut. The biggest fear is the \u201cscale\u2011vs\u2011personal touch\u201d dilemma: if we grow beyond the 5\u2011km radius, do we lose the intimacy? To counter that, we\u2019re building a \u201cNeighbourhood Ambassador\u201d program where power users (like my friend Neha, who runs a yoga studio in Versova) become local curators, vetting vendors and sharing stories on the platform.\n\nWe pitched the idea at the \u201cStartup Weekend Mumbai\u201d in August\u202f2024, held at",

The group chat (my besties \u2013 Neha, Ananya, and I) erupted in emojis. We all decided to hit the **H&M** outlet at **Linkage Mall** the next weekend.

I had to explain that I was actually \u201ccoding\u201d \u2013 and that the techno beats help me focus. Then there\u2019s the moment when my aunt, who lives in Dadar and only knows Bollywood classics, heard me humming \u201cShake It Off\u201d while I was on a video call with the client at Jio\u2019s office in Powai.

Our WhatsApp chat was a riot of emojis, GIFs, and the occasional \u201cYaar, let\u2019s book the next trip already!\u201d  \n\nThe Lonavala trip was supposed to be our comeback after the pandemic lockdowns. We booked a boutique homestay called \u201cThe Treehouse\u201d on 12\u202fMay\u202f2022. The first night we all piled into the Sea Link, blasting Badshah\u2019s \u201cGenda Phool\u201d at full volume, and the view of the Arabian Sea glittering under the sunset was insane. The next day we hiked to Rajmachi Fort, and Priya\u2019s Instagram reel of us doing a goofy \u201ccheese\u2011face\u201d at the top got 12k likes. That night we ate at \u201cThe Nutcracker\u201d in Lonavala, and Ananya\u2019s story about the mushroom risotto still makes me smile.\n\nFast forward to early 2023: after Lonavala, we tried to keep the momentum. I suggested a quick weekend in Goa for the 4th of July 2023\u2014Riya was already planning a \u201cMonsoon\u2011Monsoon\u201d photo\u2011shoot at Palolem, Meera was supposed to bring her new DSLR, Priya wanted to scout a boutique space in Panjim, and Ananya promised a \u201cfood crawl\u201d of Goan seafood. I even created a Doodle poll on 15\u202fJune\u202f2023 and sent a Google Sheet with budget breakdowns. But then something shifted.\n\nRiya got a promotion at Myntra and was transferred to their Bangalore office in August\u202f2023. She started posting long \u201cgoodbye Mumbai\u201d stories on Instagram, and her messages in the group turned into short \u201cCongrats!\u201d emojis. Meera, who was already juggling a big project at TCS (the \u201cAI\u2011Assist\u201d rollout for internal tools), started working nights and stopped replying after 10\u202fpm.

Their feedback saves me from an awkward mismatch (remember the Lenskart glasses? The group said they looked too \u201cinfluencer\u2011ish\u201d, so I changed the angle).\n\n- **Community Building**: My Close Friends list is essentially a digital version of the coffee\u2011shop circle I have at **Candies** on Hill Road.

The first time I realized it was more than just \u201cbad skin\u201d was in March\u202f2022, when I walked into my 2\u2011BHK after a night out at The Little Door and stared at a fresh, angry cyst on my chin that looked like a tiny volcano. I was already dealing with those stubborn, hormonal breakouts that would pop up after every stressful deadline at my marketing job at Swiggy\u2019s brand team, but that March cyst was the moment I booked an appointment at Dr. Rupa Shah\u2019s PCOD clinic at Lilavati Hospital.\n\nThe first visit was a whirlwind of blood tests, an ultrasound, and a 30\u2011minute lecture from Dr. Shah about insulin resistance, androgen levels, and why my skin was acting like a teenage rebel. She prescribed Metformin 500\u202fmg twice a day and a low\u2011dose oral contraceptive (Yaz), plus a regimen of topical treatments: The Ordinary Niacinamide\u202f10% + Zinc\u202f1% in the mornings, and a 2% Azelaic Acid cream (Paula\u2019s Choice) at night. I still have the prescription slip tucked in my Bandra wallet, the one with the doodle of a mango on the corner\u2014Dr. Shah\u2019s quirky habit.\n\nManaging breakouts became a full\u2011time side hustle. I\u2019d spend my evenings after the 9\u202fpm \u201cBandra Bandstand\u201d walk with my dog, Momo, scrolling through Instagram reels of dermatologists swearing by \u201cBHA + AHA\u201d combos. I finally settled on a routine that didn\u2019t make my skin feel like a desert: a gentle cleanser (Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser), followed by The Ordinary Lactic Acid 5% + HA, then the Niacinamide serum, and finally a light moisturizer (Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Gel). On breakout days, I\u2019d add a spot\u2011treatment of Benzoyl Peroxide 2.5% (La Roche\u2011Posay Effaclar Duo) and a cold compress from the fridge. The results? My cystic acne has reduced from \u201cmonthly eruptions\u201d to \u201conce every two months,\u201d but the occasional papules still pop up, especially after a stressful sprint for a new campaign",

I started seeing a therapist at The Mind Studio in Bandra (Dr. Nisha Patel) once a week. Our sessions revolve around CBT techniques and a lot of \u201cwhat if\u201d scenarios\u2014like, \u201cWhat if I can\u2019t control my anger?\u201d\u2014which surprisingly helped me label the hormonal fog as \u201cPCOD\u2011related mood dysregulation\u201d instead of personal failure.\n\nNow, the most entertaining (and exhausting) part: the aunties. My mother\u2019s sister, Auntie Sunita, lives in Dadar and calls me every Sunday at 5\u202fpm, right after I finish my \u201cBandra Gym\u201d session (I\u2019m still trying to stick to the 3\u2011times\u2011a\u2011week HIIT class at Fitness First). She starts with, \u201cBeta, you need to drink more ghee, it\u2019ll balance your hormones,\u201d and then goes on to recommend \u201cno coffee, only herbal tea, and definitely stop eating paneer.\u201d She also swears by \u201cturmeric milk with honey\u201d as the ultimate cure. I love her, but the advice feels like a script from a 1990s Bollywood drama. I politely thank her, then head to my kitchen and brew a cold brew from Blue Tokai (because, yaar, I need caffeine for the morning sprint) while adding a dash of fish oil (Nordic Naturals) that my doctor recommended for omega\u20113.\n\nThe most persistent auntie advice came from my mom\u2019s friend, Mrs. Patel, who runs a small boutique in Khar (she sells hand\u2011embroidered kurtas).

I\u2019ve started a \u201cSunday Self\u2011Care\u201d ritual: a 30\u2011minute yoga session at The Yoga Studio in Bandra (they have a special \u201cPCOD\u2011friendly\u201d flow), followed by a facial mask\u2014Azelaic Acid + Niacinamide\u2014while I binge\u2011watch \u201cSatyameva Jayate\u201d on Netflix. The combination of movement, mindfulness, and targeted skincare keeps the breakouts in check and the mood swings less dramatic.\n\nIn short, PCOD is a constant negotiation. It\u2019s the daily balancing act between taking Metformin, resisting Auntie Sunita\u2019s ghee advice, managing a career that demands 24\u2011hour creativity, and staying kind to myself when the hormones decide to throw a tantrum. I\u2019ve learned to celebrate the small wins\u2014a clear skin day, a calm evening without a mood swing, or even just finishing a cup of cold brew without feeling guilty. And every time an auntie calls with another \u201cmiracle cure,\u201d I smile, nod, and remind myself that I\u2019m the one who knows my body best. The struggle isn\u2019t over, but I\u2019ve finally stopped letting it define me.",

      "text": "## The 'Pilates' Phase: Did she join because she like...\nI signed up for Pilates in late\u202fJanuary\u202f2022, right after the New Year rush at my office (I was still a junior content strategist at Swiggy\u2019s Mumbai hub). The first thing that pushed me over the line was the Instagram story Ayesha posted on 5\u202fJan\u202f2022: a 15\u2011second clip of her doing the \u201cHundred\u201d on a teal Manduka mat at **Pilates Studio on Hill Road, Bandra West**. The caption read, \u201c#PilatesLife \u2013 feeling the burn, yaar! \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffd\u201d. Within an hour, my phone buzzed with three more stories\u2014Riya from the design team, my cousin Nikhil (who\u2019s been doing CrossFit at **Fit4Life**, Bandra East), and even my neighbour, Mrs. Mehta, who posted a selfie in front of the studio\u2019s glass fa\u00e7ade, all with the same #PilatesVibes hashtag.\n\nI\u2019d always been curious about Pilates because I\u2019d read a 2019 article in *The Hindu* about how the discipline helps with posture\u2014something I desperately needed after months of slouching at my desk, typing away on a MacBook Pro. My own back pain had hit a peak in November\u202f2021, and the physiotherapist at **Dr. Prasad\u2019s Clinic** (Juhu) suggested core strengthening. That was the \u201cI actually like it\u201d part of the equation.\n\nBut the \u201ceveryone in Bandra is doing it\u201d part was impossible to ignore. By March\u202f2022, every caf\u00e9 conversation at **Candies**, every brunch at **The Nutcracker**, and even the chatter at the **Bandra Gym** (the one next to the Bandra Railway Station) revolved around Pilates. A 3\u2011minute segment on **NDTV\u2019s \u201cMumbai Beat\u201d** (aired 12\u202fMar\u202f2022) featured Shreya Mehta, the lead instructor at the Hill Road studio, talking about the \u201cPilates wave\u201d sweeping SoBo. She mentioned that enrollment had jumped 45\u202f% in the last six months, mostly because \u201cpeople see their friends posting and want to be part of the community.\u201d\n\nSo when I walked into the studio on **7\u202fFeb\u202f2022** for the trial class, I was both excited and a little nervous. The room smelled faintly of eucalyptus, the playlist was a mix of lo\u2011fi beats and classic Bollywood remixes",

Shreya greeted us with a warm \u201cNamaste, ladies! Let\u2019s work on that core, shall we?\u201d I remember the first mat\u2014my Lululemon \u201cAlign\u201d mat\u2014slipping a bit as I tried the roll\u2011up, and the instructor\u2019s gentle correction: \u201cEngage your pelvic floor, think of pulling your belly button towards your spine.\u201d The sensation of that controlled breathing, the subtle burn in my transverse abdominis, felt oddly satisfying. By the end of the 55\u2011minute session, my heart rate (tracked on my **Fitbit Charge\u202f5**) was at 132\u202fbpm, and I felt a mix of exhaustion and exhilaration.\n\nAfter that class, I booked a monthly membership (\u20b97,500 for 4 weeks, unlimited). The decision was a blend: I genuinely enjoyed the precision and the way Pilates made my shoulders relax after long Zoom calls, but I also didn\u2019t want to miss out on the social ripple that was turning into a Bandra\u2011wide trend. It became a regular Thursday evening ritual: I\u2019d meet Ayesha for a quick **chai** at **Starbucks (Bandra Kurla Complex)**, then head straight to the studio. The community vibe\u2014post\u2011class selfies, the \u201cPilates Club\u201d WhatsApp group where we share tips about the best **Brahmin\u2019s** protein bars or the latest **Decathlon** yoga wear\u2014kept me hooked.\n\nLooking back, I\u2019d say the \u201cliked it\u201d part was the core (pun intended) reason I stayed, but the \u201ceveryone was doing it\u201d factor was the catalyst that got me through the initial hesitation.

I\u2019d just landed a junior product\u2011marketing role at Swiggy\u2019s Bangalore office and the whole \u201cnew city, new responsibilities\u201d vibe was making me feel like a hamster on a wheel. My friend Rhea (we met at the 2019 Kumbh Mela hackathon) kept texting me, \u201cYaar, you need someone to vent to besides your mom\u2019s WhatsApp group.\u201d So I booked an appointment at The Mind Lounge on Hill Road, Bandra West \u2013 a sleek, pastel\u2011colored space with floor\u2011to\u2011ceiling windows that overlook the street where Candies still serves its famous pistachio milkshake.\n\nMy therapist is Dr\u202fAnjali Mehta, a 38\u2011year\u2011old clinical psychologist who\u2019s also a certified yoga instructor. I remember the first session: she wore a navy kurti, her hair in a low bun, and there was a tiny potted succulent on the desk that smelled faintly of eucalyptus. She asked me to describe my \u201ccurrent narrative\u201d and I blurted out, \u201cI feel like I\u2019m living two lives \u2013 the Instagram\u2011perfect SoBo girl who\u2019s always at the latest pop\u2011up at Bandra Reclamation, and the anxious kid who still cries when the power goes out during monsoon.\u201d She smiled, wrote \u201cdual narrative\u201d on a sticky note, and placed it on the board beside a sketch of a split mango \u2013 sweet on one side, sour on the other.\n\nWe\u2019ve been meeting every Thursday at 7\u202fpm, usually for 50\u202fminutes. The sessions are a mix of talk therapy, CBT exercises, and occasional mindfulness breathing that I do while looking out at the traffic on Hill Road. In September\u202f2023, after a particularly stressful product launch (the \u201cSwiggy Go\u201d feature that crashed on the night of Diwali), I walked into the room feeling like my heart was doing a Bollywood dance.

When I mentioned my love for street\u2011food (the pani\u2011puri stall at Pali Hill that still uses the same old brass bowl), she asked me to write a \u201cfood journal\u201d linking flavors to moods. That exercise helped me realize that my happiest moments are the ones where I\u2019m messy, like the night I spilled masala chai on my white kurta at the rooftop party in Khar and laughed it off with friends.\n\nI\u2019m not a \u201ctherapy\u2011only\u201d person; I still use other coping tools \u2013 I have a Spotify playlist called \u201cMellow Moods\u201d (curated in 2021 with songs like \u201cKahin Toh Hogi Woh\u201d and \u201cShallow\u201d), I do a 15\u2011minute sun\u2011salutation routine at the Bandra Gym (the one next to the old cinema hall), and I journal in a Moleskine that I bought from Crossword in 2020. But Dr\u202fAnjali is the anchor. She reminds me that it\u2019s okay to feel conflicted about my career trajectory, especially when I see my peers from college (the 2018 batch of St. Xavier\u2019s) already buying flats in Powai. She also celebrates my small wins \u2013 like the day I got the \u201cBest Campaign\u201d award at Swiggy in January\u202f2024, and we did a quick \u201ccelebration breathing\u201d where we inhaled for four seconds, held for two, exhaled for six, and I could actually feel the tension melt away.\n\nThe biggest shift happened after the monsoon of 2025.

Back then I was a total \u201cno\u2011glasses\u201d rebel, convinced that the thin, clear lenses would keep me looking sharp for my budding \u201csocial media intern\u201d role at Times Internet. I still use Acuvue Oasys with HydraLuxe \u2013 the ones that claim 24\u2011hour moisture.  \n\nThe thing is, my job at a fintech startup in Andheri (I\u2019m a growth\u2011hacker for a crypto\u2011payments platform) is a marathon of screen time. I start at 9\u202fam, sip masala chai at the office pantry while scrolling through JIRA tickets, and by 6\u202fpm I\u2019ve already clocked 9\u201110\u202fhours of staring at a 27\u2011inch Dell UltraSharp (the one with the \u201cComfortView\u201d panel that supposedly reduces blue light).  \n\nEvery evening, when I finally step out of the building on the 12th floor of the G Block, the Mumbai heat hits me like a wall of humidity. I take the lift down to the ground floor, grab a quick vada pav from Anand Stall near the lobby, and then head straight to the beach promenade at Marine Drive for a 15\u2011minute walk. The salty breeze feels great, but my eyes scream.  \n\nThe contacts start to feel like tiny sandpaper discs. By the time I\u2019m back at my flat in Bandra West (Apartment 3B, 2nd floor, building \u201cThe Loft\u201d), the lenses are practically glued to my corneas. I\u2019ve learned the hard way not to rub them \u2013 it only makes the dryness worse and sometimes leads to a tiny red spot that looks like a bruise.  \n\nMy go\u2011to rescue kit is a small 5\u202fml bottle of Blink Tears (the preservative\u2011free drops I bought from Apollo Pharmacy on Linking Road in 2022). I keep one on my desk, one in my bag, and one in the bathroom sink. The moment I blink a few times and squeeze a drop, there\u2019s an instant \u201cwhoosh\u201d of relief, like a mini\u2011rainstorm over a desert. Still, the relief is fleeting.  \n\nOn days when I have a back\u2011to\u2011back presentation for the \u201cBandra Tech Meet\u2011up\u201d (the one on 12\u202fOct\u202f2024 at the Bombay Arts Society), the dryness spikes.

I also keep a small humidifier (the Levoit LV600HH) running in my bedroom at night; I swear the extra moisture in the air cuts down the next morning\u2019s irritation by half.  \n\nI tried switching to monthly lenses (Air Optix Aqua) in early 2023 after a nasty episode where a colleague\u2019s cat knocked my contact case off the desk, and I almost lost a lens. The monthly lenses feel a bit more breathable, but the daily ones are still my favorite because I can toss them after work and not worry about cleaning solutions (I\u2019m still terrified of the \u201cRenu\u201d bottle that smells like chemicals).  \n\nSometimes I wonder if I should go for LASIK. I booked a consultation with Dr.\u202fRohit Shah at the Ophthalmology Centre in Nariman Point back in March\u202f2025. He ran a thorough corneal topography, and the verdict was: \u201cYou\u2019re a good candidate, but you need to manage dry eye first.\u201d He suggested a pre\u2011op regimen of Restasis (prescribed by my optometrist at Vision Express, Bandra Kurla Complex) and a strict screen\u2011break schedule.  \n\nUntil then, I\u2019m stuck in this love\u2011hate relationship with contacts: they give me that sleek, \u201cno\u2011glasses\u201d vibe for client calls on Zoom (especially when I\u2019m pitching to the CEO of a Mumbai\u2011based startup at 3\u202fpm on a Tuesday), but they also remind me daily that my eyes are fragile.

I caught myself rehearsing the message in the mirror, trying to sound casual: \u201cHey, no rush, just when you\u2019re able\u2026\u201d  \n\n3. **The group chat dynamic amplifies awkwardness** \u2013 When you post a public link, everyone can see who\u2019s paid and who hasn\u2019t. It\u2019s like a scoreboard at a cricket match; you don\u2019t want to be the one with a red dot. I ended up DM\u2011ing Ayesha privately, hoping to avoid public shaming, but that still left me with the mental load of tracking who owes what.  \n\n4. **Cultural nuance: \u201cLending\u201d vs \u201cSharing\u201d** \u2013 In my family, we never say \u201cI\u2019m lending you money\u201d; we say \u201cI\u2019m covering it for you.\u201d So when I say \u201cI\u2019ve paid, please settle,\u201d it feels like I\u2019m asking them to *return* a favor rather than *pay back* a loan, which adds a layer of subtle pressure.  \n\n5. **The solution? A mix of transparency and grace** \u2013 I now add a line in the Splitwise note: \u201cPay whenever you can, no rush \u2013 just let me know if you need more time.\u201d I also set a personal rule: if a friend hasn\u2019t paid after 7\u202fdays, I\u2019ll give them a \u201csoft nudge\u201d in a private chat, not a group reminder.  \n\nThe whole episode taught me that even in a city as tech\u2011savvy as Mumbai, where everyone has UPI on their fingertips, the human element\u2014cash flow anxiety, pride, and the desire not to be a \u201cmoney\u2011chaser\u201d\u2014still makes asking friends to pay back on Splitwise a delicate dance. And every time I hear the \u201cding\u201d of a UPI notification, I\u2019m reminded of that March weekend, the mango panna cotta, the extra garlic, and the unspoken rule that money can be the most awkward part of a friendship, even in the age of instant payments.\n\n age of instant payments.",

I was sitting on the sofa in our Bandra\u2011West flat, the monsoon drizzle tapping against the windows, and my mom was in the kitchen humming \u201cAap Ki Nazron Se\u201d while flipping aloo paratha. The moment the notification popped, my heart did that weird flutter\u2011but\u2011steady\u2011beat you get when you finally see something you\u2019ve worked for.\n\nFirst thing I did was open the \u201cMy Salary Slip\u201d PDF from WATConsult (the agency I\u2019d joined as a junior copy\u2011writer right after my B.Com in 2022). The net was \u20b945,200 after PF, tax, and that tiny \u201cprofessional tax\u201d deduction that always feels like a joke. I stared at the number for a minute, then whispered, \u201cYaar, finally!\u201d and slipped my phone into my pocket.\n\nTwo things were already plotted in my head:\n\n1. **A bag** \u2013 I\u2019d been eyeing the **Coach Tabby 20** in caramel leather for months. It was on sale at **Myntra** (\u20b923,990 after the 15% \u201cMonsoon Madness\u201d discount). The bag had a gold\u2011tone hardware, a detachable strap, and that subtle \u201cCoach\u201d emboss that screams \u201cI\u2019ve made it\u201d without being loud. I\u2019d even saved a screenshot of the product page on my phone, complete with the size chart and the user reviews that said \u201cperfect for office & brunch\u201d.\n\n2. **Dinner for Mom & Dad** \u2013 I wanted to take them out to **The Table** in Colaba. Their new \u201cMaharashtrian Thali\u201d was \u20b91,250 per plate, and they love the sea\u2011view terrace. I\u2019d been saving up for a \u201cfamily treat\u201d ever since my first semester at St.\u202fXaviers, when I\u2019d splurge on a movie ticket for them.\n\nSo, after a quick coffee at **Starbucks** on Carter Road (\u20b9250 for a tall latte, because I needed caffeine to keep my hands steady), I opened the Myntra app, added the Coach bag to the cart, and hit \u201cBuy Now\u201d. The checkout screen showed the final amount: \u20b923,990 + \u20b91,200 shipping (they were doing free delivery that day, thank God) + \u20b91,200 GST = **\u20b925,190**. I entered my debit card",

I felt a weird mix of triumph and a tiny pinch of guilt because I\u2019d just spent more than half my salary.\n\nNext, I texted my dad, \u201cPapa, dinner on me tonight at The Table. Bring your appetite, we\u2019re celebrating my first salary!\u201d He replied with a classic, \u201cBeta, you\u2019re already making us proud.

I sat on the curb, watching the rain lighten, and thought about how the bag would soon be hanging on my shoulder, the leather softening with each commute to the office on Bandra\u2011Kurla Complex.\n\nThe next morning, I called the **Coach** store in **Phoenix Marketcity** just to confirm the delivery slot. The sales associate, Priya, told me the bag would be in the \u201cReady for Pickup\u201d section on Thursday at 2\u202fPM. I made a mental note: \u201cDon\u2019t forget to bring my ID and the order confirmation screenshot.\u201d\n\nWhen the day finally arrived (Thursday, 20\u202fAugust\u202f2022), I took the local train from **Bandra** to **Kurla**, then a quick auto\u2011rickshaw to Phoenix. The store was buzzing with the usual weekend crowd, but the \u201cReady for Pickup\u201d counter had a small, neat pile of boxes. My bag was there, wrapped in a glossy black paper with the Coach logo printed in gold.

We toasted with a glass of **Sula Brut** (\u20b91,500 for the bottle, split among us). Mom\u2019s eyes were glossy, and she said, \u201cBeta, you\u2019ve always been our pride.

I\u2019d just hopped off the **Western Line** at **Bandra (West) station**, the platform still buzzing with the usual mix of college kids, office go\u2011ers and the occasional tourist snapping selfies at the iconic **Bandra\u2013Worli Sea Link** backdrop.\n\nI was dragging my **Moleskine** notebook, a half\u2011finished pitch deck, and a tote bag full of sample swag (think printed tees from **Candies** and a few eco\u2011friendly water bottles). My phone was at 22% and I had a quick Zoom call scheduled with the client at **6\u202fpm**, so I needed to get to **Pali Hill** in under twenty minutes. The auto\u2011rickshaw stand, just a stone\u2019s throw from the station exit, seemed like the fastest way.\n\nI walked straight to the **auto stand** and waved at the first driver, a lanky guy with a **Maruti Suzuki Alto** painted in a faded turquoise. He was busy negotiating a fare with a couple of school kids. I shouted, \u201c**Bhai, 20\u202fmin for Pali Hill, please!**\u201d He glanced at me, shrugged, and said, \u201c**Nahi yaar, already full.**\u201d I tried again, \u201c**Ek seat, please.**\u201d He shook his head, revved the engine, and drove off, leaving a cloud of exhaust.\n\nUndeterred, I moved to the second auto \u2013 a **Toyota Etios** with a sticker that read \u201c**Best Driver in Bandra**\u201d.

It was a scorching Thursday, 22\u202fMarch, and I was on the hunt for a one\u2011bhk near Bandra\u2011West because my new role at Swiggy\u2019s growth team demanded a shorter commute. My roommate, Riya, had just signed a lease at a 2BHK in Pali Hill, so I was desperate to find something that felt like a step\u2011up\u2014something with a view, a bit of \u201cwow\u201d factor for when I host after\u2011work drinks.\n\nEnter Mr.\u202fKumar, a broker I\u2019d met at the Candies coffee shop on Hill Road. He was slick, always in a crisp white shirt, and he\u2019d been bragging about a \u201cprime sea\u2011view flat\u201d in the newly launched Sea\u2011View Heights, a 12\u2011storey tower on the ground floor of the old Khar D\u2011block (the one that used to be a dumping ground for construction debris). He showed me a glossy brochure with a sunrise over the Arabian Sea, the kind of picture you see on Instagram when influencers do \u201cmorning yoga on the balcony\u201d.\n\nWe met at the property on 25\u202fMarch at 5\u202fpm. The building was a concrete box with a tiny, rust\u2011stained stairwell that led up to the 4th floor, where the flat was. The moment I stepped inside, the \u201csea view\u201d turned into a \u201cdrain view\u201d. The balcony opened onto a narrow, open\u2011air storm\u2011water channel that ran parallel to the sea, but it was a filthy, black\u2011eyed gutter clogged with leaves, plastic bags, and the occasional stray cat\u2019s waste. The smell was a mix of damp concrete and stale sewage\u2014nothing like the fresh salty breeze the brochure promised.\n\nMr.\u202fKumar tried to spin it. \u201cYaar, that\u2019s just the secondary drainage. The real view is from the rooftop terrace, you know? And during low tide you can actually see the sea beyond the channel.\u201d He gestured dramatically, pointing to the distant horizon where the sea was indeed visible, but it was blocked by a concrete wall and a chain\u2011link fence.

The rent is \u20b9\u202f45,000 per month, which is a steal for a sea\u2011view in Bandra.\u201d\n\nI left the flat feeling a mix of anger, embarrassment, and a weird sense of being duped. I texted Riya, \u201cBro, the \u2018sea view\u2019 is actually a drain. Don\u2019t even joke about it.\u201d She replied, \u201cOMG, you\u2019re not serious? That\u2019s a nightmare.

And relief because the incident forced me to finally get my licence sorted\u2014by the next morning I was at the Andheri RTO, standing in a queue of about thirty people, all of us scrolling through our phones, waiting for the clerk to call our numbers.

I was 21, fresh out of college, working as a junior copywriter at Dentsu Creative, and I\u2019d just started a \u201csituationship\u201d with Arjun Mehta \u2013 the guy from the data analytics team who always ordered the same caramel macchiato from Starbucks on the 5th floor and would text me at 2\u202fam about the latest Netflix series.\n\nOur whole thing was a mess of \u201clet\u2019s keep it casual\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m not ready for labels\u201d. We\u2019d meet at the rooftop of the Gopal\u2019s Caf\u00e9 in Khar, where the city lights flickered like a movie set, and we\u2019d talk about everything from the new iPhone 15 launch (which I pretended to be excited about just to keep the convo going) to the fact that we both hated the traffic on the Western Express Highway during rush hour. The first time he played \u201cTujhe Kitna Chahne Lage\u201d on his Bluetooth speaker at his parents\u2019 apartment in Juhu, I was sitting cross\u2011legged on his sofa, sipping a cold Coca\u2011Cola, and I thought, \u201cOkay, this is just a song, nothing more.\u201d\n\nBut then, on 19\u202fDecember\u202f2022, we went to Marine Drive for a \u201cjust friends\u201d night out after a long week of deadlines at the ad agency. It was raining lightly, the sea breeze was cold, and the streetlights reflected off the wet pavement. We shared a single plate of pav bhaji from a stall that had a handwritten sign saying \u201cBest Bhaji in Town \u2013 150\u201d. While we ate, Arjun kept glancing at his phone, scrolling through Instagram stories, and then suddenly he said, \u201cI think we need to talk.\u201d He didn\u2019t say what, just that he felt something was off. I felt my heart drop. He told me he was seeing someone else \u2013 a \u201cfriend\u201d from his yoga class \u2013 but that he didn\u2019t want to break what we had because \u201cit\u2019s complicated\u201d.\n\nThe next day, I was on my way to a client meeting at the Bandra Kurla Complex (BKC) when I saw a billboard for the same song, \u201cTujhe Kitna Chahne Lage\u201d,",

I stared at it for a full minute, feeling the sting of his words. That night, I played the track on my Bose headphones while scrolling through Swiggy orders \u2013 I ordered a butter chicken from Biryani By Kilo and ate it alone in my tiny flat on Pali Hill. The lyrics that once felt romantic now sounded like a cruel reminder of the half\u2011promised affection.\n\nEvery time the opening piano chords start, I flash back to the moment Arjun whispered \u201cI\u2019m not ready\u201d while we were standing under the umbrella at the Marine Drive promenade, the rain mixing with the salty air, and his hand slipping from mine. I can still hear the distant honk of an Uber auto\u2011rickshaw passing by, the smell of wet concrete, and the taste of that pav bhaji lingering on my tongue.\n\nSince then, I\u2019ve banned the song from my playlists. I deleted it from my phone, told my friends not to play it at our Sunday brunches at The Table, and even asked the DJ at the club \u201cA\u2011Level\u201d in Lower Parel to skip it whenever it popped up. It\u2019s weird how a single track can become a scar, but that\u2019s the price of a situationship that never gave me closure.

I\u2019d been chatting with Rohit (the guy who worked at a fintech startup in Andheri) for a week on Instagram, and we finally decided to meet for a \u201cchill coffee\u201d after his 6\u202fpm yoga class. He showed up in a crisp white shirt, a navy blazer, and those perfectly manicured nails that looked like they belonged on a nail\u2011art influencer\u2019s Instagram reel. I tried to stay polite, but every time he lifted his hand to gesture, I could see the chipped polish, the jagged edges, and a faint smell of cheap acrylic glue. It felt like he\u2019d spent more time at the nail salon than at the gym. I kept catching myself mentally counting how many times I\u2019d have to say \u201cplease don\u2019t scratch me\u201d in my head.

We were strolling along the promenade, the sea breeze mixing with the smell of roasted peanuts from the street vendors. He tried to impress me with his \u201ccool\u201d slang, but every sentence came out with a weird mix of Hindi and broken English: \u201cI am go to the mall later, you wanna come?\u201d and \u201cShe is so cute, I like her much.\u201d It wasn\u2019t just cute; it felt like he wasn\u2019t even trying to communicate clearly.

We were supposed to talk about the new TikTok ad campaign we both loved. Halfway through, his phone buzzed, then vibrated, then lit up with a WhatsApp group notification about a cricket match. He kept glancing at the screen, typing, and even excused himself to \u201ccheck something important.\u201d I felt like I was dating a piece of technology, not a person.

He bragged about his \u201cextensive palate\u201d and how he could spot a good **Biryani** from a mile away.

The chandeliers were dripping with crystal, the orchestra was already tuning, and I could hear the faint hum of the barista at the lobby caf\u00e9 whipping up a masala chai for the early\u2011arriving guests. I slipped my hand into the silk\u2011brocade lehenga I\u2019d bought from Sabyasachi in 2022 \u2013 the deep maroon one with gold zari work, a high\u2011waist flare and a dupatta that fell like a waterfall. It felt like a dream the first time I wore it at my friend Ananya\u2019s wedding in Malad on 2\u202fJanuary\u202f2023, but now, three months later, the same lehenga was about to make its third appearance.\n\nThe first time was a total whirlwind. Ananya\u2019s wedding was at The Oberoi, and I\u2019d spent a whole Saturday (31\u202fDecember\u202f2022) at the boutique in Bandra West, negotiating with the sales associate about the perfect fit. I remember the scent of sandalwood incense in the fitting room and the way the saleswoman, Priya, kept saying \u201cYeh lehenga aapke liye perfect hai, you\u2019ll be the star of the night.\u201d I paired it with a gold Kundan set from Tanishq and got my hair done by a freelance stylist, Riya, who used a mix of loose curls and a side braid. The whole thing felt magical \u2013 I was 22, fresh out of college, and the compliments kept rolling in: \u201cWow, you look like a Bollywood heroine!\u201d I was on cloud nine.\n\nFast forward to 14\u202fMarch\u202f2025, and the same lehenga is now a little tighter around my waist. I\u2019ve put on a few extra pounds from the endless samosas and jalebi at the countless pre\u2011wedding parties. I\u2019m also working full\u2011time at OYO\u2019s marketing team, juggling product launches and data dashboards, so the last thing I wanted was another \u201crepeat outfit\u201d drama.

I arrived in a Uber Black, the driver (Mr. Patel, who always asks if I\u2019m \u201cgoing to the wedding again?\u201d) giving me a sympathetic smile. I swapped the gold Kundan set for a fresh set of emerald green Polki work from Amrapali, hoping the new jewellery would make the lehenga feel less \u201cre\u2011used\u201d. My makeup artist, Nisha from the boutique \u201cMaven\u201d, suggested a bold winged eyeliner and a deep plum lip, which I loved because it added a new vibe to the old outfit.\n\nBy the time I was at the third wedding \u2013 my cousin Rhea\u2019s mehendi in Bandra on 12\u202fJuly\u202f2025 \u2013 the fatigue was palpable. The mehendi artist, Shweta, was setting up her station at the rooftop of our family\u2019s apartment building, with marigold garlands and a DJ playing old Bollywood hits. I was already feeling the \u201cwedding season hangover\u201d. The same lehenga, now with a few tiny snags on the hem from the previous night\u2019s dance floor, was hanging on my closet door. I tried to convince myself that the mehendi was a low\u2011key affair, so maybe the same outfit would go unnoticed. But as soon as I stepped onto the terrace, a cousin whispered, \u201cYaar, same lehenga again? We\u2019re gonna see the same Instagram post tomorrow.\u201d My face flushed, not because of the heat but because the whole scene felt like a loop.\n\nThe emotional rollercoaster was a mix of guilt, exhaustion, and a tiny spark of rebellion.

Yet there was also a small, stubborn part of me that thought, \u201cIf the lehenga still shines, why can\u2019t I make it work?\u201d I tried to offset the repetition with accessories: a statement clutch from H&M\u2019s \u201cConscious\u201d line, a pair of chunky Jhumkas from \u201cBata\u201d, and a fresh hairstyle \u2013 a sleek high bun with a few loose tendrils, styled by my sister, who swore she\u2019d never let me wear the same thing thrice.\n\nIn the end, the third appearance of the maroon lehenga felt less like a fashion faux pas and more like a silent protest against the endless consumerism of wedding season. I posted a candid selfie on Instagram with the caption, \u201cSame lehenga, different vibes \u2013 because love (and budget) doesn\u2019t have to be new every time. #WeddingSeasonFatigue #LehengaChronicles\u201d.

I decided to postpone, but the hotel required a 48\u2011hour notice for cancellation, which I missed. So the whole thing went poof. I ended up ordering **Pizzavola** from **Domino\u2019s** and binge\u2011watching **The Crown** while staring at the sea\u2011link traffic.\n\n**2025 \u2013 The \u201cFinal\u201d Attempt (and the Loop Continues)**  \nThis year, I tried to be strategic. I booked a **co\u2011working retreat** at **The Beach House, Palolem** for 12\u201115\u202fJuly, combining work and play. The idea was to have a \u201cdigital detox\u201d but still meet a few deadlines via a **Wi\u2011Fi** hotspot. I booked a **Goa\u2011to\u2011Bandra train** (the **Konkan Railway**) for the return, thinking the train would be less stressful than a flight. Two weeks before, my team at **Zynga** announced a \u201cglobal rollout\u201d of a new feature, with a mandatory **all\u2011hands** on 14\u202fJuly. I tried to negotiate a \u201cpartial remote\u201d arrangement, but the leadership insisted on full attendance. I ended up cancelling the train ticket at the last minute, and the **Beach House** refunded me after a 10\u2011day processing period. Now I\u2019m stuck watching the **Marine Drive** sunrise, sipping **Cold Brew** from **Starbucks** (the one near **Khar West**), and scrolling through my **WhatsApp** group chat where everyone is",

We were both fresh\u2011outs at the new B2B marketing team of **Zomato\u2019s Cloud Kitchen division**, and the onboarding session was a 3\u2011hour slog of PowerPoints, KPI sheets and the ever\u2011present \u201cLet\u2019s keep the camera on, folks!\u201d reminder from our manager, Nikhil.\n\nRhea popped up on my screen wearing a bright pink \u201cBandra Bandstand\u201d tee (the one she bought at **Candies** last Diwali) and a pair of oversized glasses that made her look like she\u2019d just walked out of a 90\u2019s Bollywood set. I was instantly relieved \u2013 finally someone who understood the whole \u201cI\u2019m a SoBo girl but I can still navigate the local train at 8\u202fam\u201d vibe.\n\nThe first thing I did was drop a \ud83d\ude48 emoji in the chat when Nikhil asked us to share our \u201cbiggest pet peeve about remote work\u201d. Rhea\u2019s reply was a quick \ud83d\ude44 followed by \u201cWi\u2011Fi on the 5th floor of my parents\u2019 house is a joke, yaar\u201d. That was the moment I knew we\u2019d become each other\u2019s sanity\u2011savers.\n\nSince then, every time a meeting drags into the \u201cCan you see my screen?\u201d loop, I\u2019m the one firing off a cascade of eye\u2011roll emojis (\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44) in the Slack channel **#zomato\u2011cloud\u2011kitchen\u2011banter**.

The next day, the design lead replied with a GIF of a cat walking backwards, captioned \u201cCircling back?

Our client, a fintech startup called Niyo, asked for a \u201cdeep dive into the funnel leakage.\u201d The senior director, Priya, started her slide deck with: \u201cWe need to align on the low\u2011hanging fruit and circle back on the next steps.\u201d I could see the client\u2019s CTO raising an eyebrow, and I could feel the room\u2019s collective sigh.

I was panicking, thinking \u201cYaar, why does everything break now?\u201d I texted my cousin, Ayesha, who\u2019s basically a full\u2011time astrologer on *AstroSage* and a part\u2011time yoga instructor.

The chai\u2019s bitterness and the faint hint of ginger act like a mental \u201creset button.\u201d The Tapri\u2019s chai is brewed in a 5\u2011liter steel pot, simmered for an hour with fresh ginger, cardamom, and a pinch of black pepper. That spice\u2011kick hits the brain\u2019s reward center\u2014instant calm.  \n2. **Budget\u2011Conscious Mood:** The campaign budget was tight; I was still paying off my student loan from St.\u202fXavier\u2019s College (graduated 2020). A cup of chai here is \u20b930, and a plate of samosas is \u20b945. Starbucks, even the \u201cTall\u201d brewed coffee, is at least \u20b9250, plus a pastry that nudges the total past \u20b9350. For a day when I\u2019m already feeling the pinch of the new rent hike in Bandra West (\u20b945,000 from \u20b942,000 last year), the Tapri feels like a small, responsible treat.  \n3. **Community Vibe:** The Tapri is a micro\u2011hub for my neighbors\u2014Mr.\u202fPatel from the next building, the yoga instructor who runs classes at the Bandra Gym, and a few freelancers who pop in for Wi\u2011Fi (the free hotspot is a blessing).

We exchanged LinkedIn contacts, and she invited me to a \u201cWomen in Tech\u201d panel at the NCPA next month. That connection would have been unlikely at the Tapri, where conversations rarely go beyond the weather and the latest Bollywood release.  \n\n**Sensory Details:** The macchiato arrives in a clear glass with a caramel drizzle forming a perfect spiral. The espresso\u2019s bitterness is balanced by the sweet caramel, and the milk foam feels velvety on my tongue.

      "text": "---\n\n### A Recent Cross\u2011Over Moment\n\nJust last week (7\u202fDec\u202f2025), I found myself at a crossroads. I had a deadline to submit the final storyboard for the \u201cMonsoon Magic\u201d campaign for a local fashion brand. My team was spread across three locations: Riya was at the Tapri, Neha was at Starbucks, and I was stuck at my apartment with a Wi\u2011Fi glitch. I decided to combine both worlds: I ordered a *Cold Brew* from Starbucks (\u20b9300) and had it delivered to the Tapri via Swiggy. The delivery boy handed me a paper cup with the Starbucks logo, and I sipped it while sitting on the plastic stools at the Tapri, listening to the rain patter on the awning. The juxtaposition felt oddly perfect\u2014Starbucks\u2019 smooth, cold brew balanced the warmth of the chai\u2011infused air around me. It reminded me that the debate isn\u2019t binary; it\u2019s a fluid dance between two cultures that both shape my daily rhythm.\n\n---\n\n### Bottom Line\n\nI don\u2019t see Tapri chai and Starbucks as rivals; they\u2019re complementary chapters in my Mumbai story. The chai is my \u201chome\u2011base\u201d\u2014cheap, comforting, and deeply rooted in the SoBo streets that raised me. Starbucks is my \u201cprofessional armor\u201d\u2014a polished, global\u2011sounding backdrop that helps me navigate the corporate maze of marketing and tech. I choose based on the time of day, the purpose of the meeting, my budget, and the vibe I need to summon. And sometimes, like on that rainy December evening, I blend them both, because why should I limit myself to one when Mumbai offers a whole spectrum of flavors?  \n\n\u2014 Ari, 24, Bandra.",
